Question:
> [!quote] I'm brand new and just setting up a system for live hybrid zoom business meetings. (recording with Zoom built in recorder) If I use OBS for my virtual camera and my mixer's output directly to Zoom, will there be a delay that I need to worry about? Thanks !

Answer:
> [!quote] My set up is similar and yes, I get the delay. The video chain lags audio quite a bit. It actually made me stop using OBS for Teams. I don't think the virtual camera has a "virtual microphone" channel to tune the delay into Zoom or Teams.

- When using [Go Pro as a Webcam](../../⬇%20INBOX,%20DROPZONE/Go%20Pro%20as%20a%20Webcam.md), there is some latency with these video.  To line them up, the audio has to be delayed.
