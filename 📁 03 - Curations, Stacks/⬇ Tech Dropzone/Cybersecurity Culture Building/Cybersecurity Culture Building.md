Building a cybersecurity culture is incredibly difficult.  By it's nature, cybersecurity needs to account for malicious intent in all aspects of the organization. Granted, a pragmatic and prioritization approach should be taken.

# Incentivizing Training and Exercises
- Rewards systems
- Recognition in company newsletters
- Special certificates
- Professional development opportunities - sponsor certifications or courses related to security
- Cyber Security Month
	- Workshops
	- Webinars
	- Tabletop exercises
- Friendly competition
- Gamifying projects?
	- For a long-term project like data governance, you could break it down into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones and then create a points system for completing each task.
	- Additionally, setting up team-based challenges can encourage collaboration and collective effort towards the larger goal.
- Maybe not. I think I'm more trying to think about how this would actually look concretely. How would I track these things? Would I need full-time employment like FTE, like a full job to gamify this stuff? I want this to be low-cost, high- benefit.
	- It sounds like you're trying to balance effective implementation with resource constraints. You want something thatâ€™s engaging but doesn't require a lot of overhead or additional full-time staff.
	- One way to manage this could be using existing project management and collaboration tools. Tools like Trello, Asana, or even Microsoft Teams can help track progress and assign points or badges for completed tasks. You can set up a system where milestones are recorded, and achievements are celebrated within these platforms.
	- To keep costs low, you could form a small cross-functional team to oversee the initiative part-time, perhaps with representatives from different departments. This way, the responsibility is shared, and it doesn't fall on a single person.
	- For tracking and leaderboards, you could use a shared spreadsheet or an existing project management tool. Many of these tools have features for tracking progress and displaying results in an engaging way.
- Gamified custom assessments, forms, questionnaires and quizzes
	- Quizzes with rewards: Kahoot or Quizizz 
	- Interactive Scenarios: branching scenario tools
- Training Approaches
	- Microlearning: Break down training into short, focused modules that employees can complete in a few minutes. TalentLMS
- Social Engineering (General Employees):
	- Simulated Phishing: Regularly conduct phishing simulations using tools like KnowBe4 or Cofense to train employees to recognize and report phishing attempts. Track improvement over time.
- IT Employees
	- Gamified Training Platforms: Use platforms like Cybrary or Hack The Box, which offer gamified learning paths and labs for hands-on experience.
- Events from Cyber Team
	- Cyber/Privacy Day: Organize events with guest speakers, workshops, and interactive activities. Use these days to highlight success stories and best practices.
	- Security Champions: Appoint security ambassadors in different departments to champion security initiatives and gather feedback. These ambassadors can facilitate communication between the security team and other departments.
- Reducing Friction:
	- Change Management
	- Feedback Mechanisms: Implement regular surveys or feedback sessions to understand employee pain points regarding security measures. Tools like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms can help gather and analyze feedback.
	- Collaborative Platforms: Use collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to create dedicated channels for security discussions. This can help foster open communication and quick resolution of issues.
- Customized Training for Departments:
    - Department-Specific Modules: Develop training modules tailored to the specific security needs and practices of different departments. This can be done using a Learning Management System (LMS) that supports customization.
    - Role-Based Training: Offer role-specific security training, ensuring that the content is relevant to the tasks and risks associated with each role.
- Do you feel like there's any innovative, unorthodox, or pragmatic ways I can go about pushing some of these?
	- Security Escape Game: virtual escape room experience where participants solve puzzles related to security concepts to "escape." This can be a fun team-building activity that reinforces security principles.
	- Interactive Security Awareness Videos: Platforms like Hapyak
	- Security Champions Program: Establish a program where employees volunteer to become security champions. Provide them with advanced training and resources, and involve them in decision-making processes related to security initiatives.
	- Security Roadshows: Organize security roadshows where the security team visits different departments to conduct live demos, answer questions, and discuss relevant security topics. This can make the security team more approachable and visible.
	- Security Innovation Lab: Set up a security innovation lab where employees can experiment with new security tools and techniques. Encourage them to come up with creative solutions to security challenges and share their findings.
	- Real-time Feedback and Rewards: Use real-time feedback tools like Kudos or Bonusly to recognize and reward employees for good security practices immediately. This can create a positive reinforcement loop and encourage ongoing vigilance.
