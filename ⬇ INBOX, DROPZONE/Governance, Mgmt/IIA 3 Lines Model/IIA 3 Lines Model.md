## Three Lines Model Overview
The Three Lines Model helps organizations identify structures and processes that best assist the achievement of objectives and facilitate strong governance and risk management. The model applies to all organizations and is optimized by:
- Start with principles
- Map risk management to actual value along with the expected protection responsibility
- Clarity of roles and responsibilities
- Measures taken to align stakeholder and governing body with lines
## Principles 
### Principle 1: Governance
- Governance of an org requires:
	- accountability to stakeholders for oversight through integrity, leadership, and transparency
	- actions (managing risk) by management to achieve objectives with risk in mind
	- assurance and advice by internal audit function - rigorous inquiry and insightful communication
### Principle 2: Governing body roles
- Ensures:
	- effective governance structures and processes
	- alignment of objectives with interests of stakeholders
- Delegation:
	- give resources and responsibility to management to achieve objectives while ensuring legal, regulatory, and ethical operation
- Establishment of internal audit function:
	- oversees independent, objective, and competent internal audit function to provide clarity on the objectives
### Principle 3: Management and 1st and 2nd line roles
- Management includes 1st and 2nd line roles - can be blended or separated
- Some second line roles can be specialist/supportive roles that give expertise, support, monitoring, and challenge to 1st line
- Second line roles can have focus on specific parts of risk management: 
	- compliance with laws, regulations, and acceptable ethical behavior; internal control; information and technology security; sustainability; and quality assurance.
- Managing risk is part of 1st line and within scope of management
### Principle 4: 3rd line roles
- Assurance and advice on management operations (risk management)
- Internal audit 
- Reports to governing body
- Alignment, communication, coordination, and collab with management
### Principle 5: 3rd line independence
- independent from responsibilities of management 
- Unfettered access to people, resources, and data needed to complete work
- They don't get slowed down by access and lack of buy in
### Principle 6: Creating and protecting value
- Alignment and collaboration increases value
- Includes alignment with stakeholders - allows governing body to have good communication, assurance, and trust with stakeholders
- Cooperation, communication, and collaboration == good decision making and coherence 
## Key Roles
### Governing Body
- Delegation, enablement, assurance to stakeholders, and expectation setting
### 1st line
- Leads and directs actions (risk mgmt) and application of resources 
- Dialogue with governing body:
	- Reports on:
		- planned, actual, and expected outcomes
		- risk
- structures and processes for management of operations and risk (including internal control)
- Ensures compliance
### 2nd line
- Provide expertise, support, monitoring, and challenge to management of risk
	- development, implementation, and continuous improvement of risk management practices at a process, systems, and entity level
- Reports to governing body with:
	- analysis and reporting on effectiveness of risk management (1st line)
