# Infragard Intro 
- You can join Infragard online
- Partnership between FBI and private sector
- SSRP - sector chiefs can organize events around critical infrastructure sectors
- You can assist sector chiefs
- Chapter site: secure indiana .org
# Ransomware & Cyberpocalyse - Steve Long
- CEO and President - Hancock Regional - Steve Long
- Why talk about it - learn to prepare
## Hancock Regional
- 1400 employees - 3 or 4 campuses
- East Central Indiana
## The Response
- Figure out how to establish a command center if the network gets locked down
	- How to communicate with customers and employees
	- Used diagnotes to communicate
- Have paper processes planned in case of failure
	- Test large scale 

- Will you be able to use preferred firms?
- Establish call cadence

- Forensics investigation
	- identify, contain, eradicate, remediate
	- Log review:
		- Malware through vendor RDP access credentials
		- Limited amount of access time
		- Pure ransom...no exfiltration or persisitence
		- SamSam variant
	- All came down to bad password hygenics
- To pay or not to pay
	- deterrent - don't pay
	- Do you have backups?
	- CBA
	- Paying makes you a big target
	- They may ask for more money

- They paid
	- Takes hours to get bitcoin
	- Have to go on dark web
	- a lot cheaper than these days - 56k

- Legal analysis
	- Exfiltration is a huge deal with HIPPA 
		- Prove it didn't occur
	- HOWEVER, now it's an incident if encryption occurred.
## Preparation
- IR plan
	- tabletop time
- Ensure coverage for preferred list of vendors
	- Lots of caveats
- Ensure liability for vendors if they are the one to blame for an attack

- Basic controls:
	- risk assessment
	- remediation plan
	- patching
		- Hospital uses KECE for patching
	- MFA
	- Vendor management
	- pentests
	- workforce training
	- behavior-based EDR
		- Cylance to SentinelOne

- TV can affect optics during an incident

## Post Attack Attack (another attack)
- AI-based protection and tons of improvements

- 2 months ago
- Gootloader into CobaltStrike
- Usually people clicking on stuff

## Other Takeaways
- Evolved to include data extortion 
- Use burner emails during incident

# How the FBI Can Help - Communications Sector Threats
## Threats
- Nation state want PII
- BGP attacks?
- Examples:
	- T-Mobile 2018 and 2019
	- Operation Soft Cell
		- Attack against telecom
- Wireless
	- SIM swaps still 
	- Nation state:
		- Supply chain attacks
		- Surveillance

- Incident Response
	- give themTTPs and IOCs

- They can tell you what the attacker usually does and what to looker for

## Planning
- Out of band communications
- Offsite/offline backups
- Phishing as always

- OFAC - Federal organization that requires you to have attorney or negotiator to get permission to pay
	- Office of foreign asset control
	- Banks fill out SARs, those go to FINSIM??, then to OFAC

- 
## Reporting
- BEC - IC3.gov, tips.fbi.gov

- Rapid
	- IC3 command post 24/7
	- Rapid Asset Recovery Team
	- They don't need wait on subpoenas
		- They have connections to banks
# Threats and Resources from CISA
- They protect .gov websites 
- Voluntary agency
- .mil is not under FISMA
	- DISA oversees those instead

- Advisor program
	- Random lead when you call FBI
		- First to answer gets the incident
	- Don't be repeat customer
- CISA regions (10) with separate emails
	- Great partnerships with our region (region 5)
- Mothership - 27 buildings in D.C area
- Joseph Henry
	- supervisor over 4 other advisors in illinois
- Shetrice 
	- another advisor from McCordsville

## Cyber Performance Goals (CPGs)
- high-impact fundamentals - basic guidelines and activities that you could perform
- Both IT and OT/ICS
- Also provide justification for expenditure

## Some Services
- Quick Nessus Scans
- Cyber Resilience Review
- External Dependencies Mgmt
- Tabletop Exercises
- Training

- Vuln Warning Pilot Program
	- at least 12 a week right now
	- They'll call you and start telling you warning signs and you just write it down

## Cyber Information Sharing
- cybersecurity advisories

## Response Numbers
- IOT (infdiana office of tech)
- CISA number of email
- FBI field office

## Vuln Catalog
- known exploited vulns

## What about phone calls 
- IC3 fraud hotline

## FBI vs CISA
- CISA is asset response
	- If you want to protect or save your stuff
- FBI is threat response
	- If you want to put someone in jail

## Utilities
- Regulated energy??
- Wabash energy???
- NERDVERC?

## Reporting Benefits
- Report when you can because it gets into the database
- 
## Other Takeaways
- Lots of times they go for smaller organizations first and just sell access as "access brokers"
- You're going to just burn down the network after you pay anyway
- Oldsmar breach 
- Trisis Saudi Eramco - Darknet Diaries
- Smishing and SMS and SIM and phone attacks are complex and controls are immature or not fully realized large scale across the industry
