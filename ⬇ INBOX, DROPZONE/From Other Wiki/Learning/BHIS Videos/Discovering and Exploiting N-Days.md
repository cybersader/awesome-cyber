# N-Days
- known vulns
- vulns have lifecycles
- workarounds and detections are usually available, but not always patches
## History of N-Days
- ![](__attachments/BHIS%20Videos/IMG-Discovering%20and%20Exploiting%20N-Days-2024063021.png)
- Tons of huge malware projects relied on EternalBlue
- Huge attacks took place after the patch
- Got leaked by ShadowBrokers
- Apache Struts was used in the Equifax breach
- ProxyNotShell - used against Rackspace in 2022
- BlackEnergy - Ukraine powergrid 
	- patching SIEMENS PLC is really not fun
- Spectre/Meltdown - CPU microcode vulns
	- sidechannel attacks
	- memory leaks
	- continue to be released
## N-Day Usage is Less Common Now
- usually creds and phishing rather than vulns
- Good security integrations with products
	- Reverse proxies
	- Next-Gen FWs
	- Endpoint products
- N-days are resource intensive and not low-hanging
# Finding N-Days
## High-Level
- Vuln mgmt team
- know env, do recon
- listen to your vendors
- scan yourself lots
- follow the news
## Live Engagement
- look at bug bounties
- don't break stuff and validate your findings with some concrete
## Recon
- be careful with cloud IPs - they rotate a lot
- Use hostnames where possible
- There are HUNDREDS of additional recon techniques that you can use to gather information about a target. Some of my favorites:

## Shodan
- You can do basic wildcard needle in haystack search 
- Scope values to specific fields
- Shodan CLI is legit
## Nuclei
- Get tool like Shodan
- GoAnywhere
	- MFT - managed file transfer vuln
	- lots of bad stuff
- Checking if target has GoAnywhere vuln
	- nuclei templates - like Nessus plugins
	- path traversal vuln with certain words that match vuln
- Nuclei puts API tokens and stuff in unknown, so it matters
