Person: 
- If I want to backup my Windows files with Duplicati, so that it's easy to use both my Windows files and apps as if they never disappeared, then which folders do I need to backup, are the main ones/default good enough, should I exclude some certain type of files with regex just in case I have to recover and might as well leave out certain files?

ChatGPT: 
- Using Duplicati to back up your Windows files is a smart way to ensure that you can recover your system to a usable state in case of data loss. When considering which folders to back up, you want to strike a balance between ensuring you have everything you might need and not using excessive storage space or including files that could complicate the recovery process. Here’s a general guide on what to consider for a comprehensive backup strategy:
### Essential Folders to Backup 
1. **User Profile Data** : 
- Path: `C:\Users\YourUsername`
- This includes documents, desktop files, pictures, music, and videos. It's also where most of your personal settings and data for applications are stored. 
2. **AppData** : 
- Located within your user folder at `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData`
- This hidden folder contains application settings, files, and data specific to the applications installed on your computer. 
3. **Email Data** : 
- If you use an email client like Outlook, you might want to back up your email data. Outlook stores data in `.pst` or `.ost` files typically located in a subfolder within `AppData`. 
4. **Program Files**  and **Program Files (x86)** : 
- Paths: `C:\Program Files` and `C:\Program Files (x86)`
- These directories contain all the program files for applications installed on your system. While backing these up can save time reinstalling applications, some applications may not work properly without a fresh install, especially those deeply integrated into the system. 
5. **Windows Folder** : 
- Path: `C:\Windows`
- Contains Windows system files and configurations. Backing this up can help you restore system settings, but for a full system restore, a system image backup is recommended.
### Files or Folders to Consider Excluding

While you want a comprehensive backup, certain files and folders are either unnecessary or can cause issues if restored from a backup: 
- **Temporary Files** : Use regular expressions to exclude files with `.tmp` or `.temp` extensions. 
- **Browser Cache** : Located in the `AppData` folder, these can take up unnecessary space and will be regenerated. 
- **System and Program Cache** : Similar to browser cache, these files don’t need to be backed up. 
- **Hibernation and Page Files** : `hiberfil.sys`, `pagefile.sys`, and `swapfile.sys` in the root of your system drive are unnecessary for backups. 
- **Windows System Restore Points** : Located in `System Volume Information`. It's better to create new restore points after restoration.
### Additional Tips 
- **Create a System Image** : For a full recovery, including the ability to restore applications and Windows files as if they never disappeared, consider creating a system image backup alongside your Duplicati backups. Tools like Windows Backup and Restore can create system images. 
- **Regular Backups** : Set Duplicati to run backups regularly to ensure that your backup is as up-to-date as possible. 
- **Test Restores** : Periodically test your backup by restoring some files to ensure that your backup strategy is effective.

Remember, the best backup strategy depends on how you use your computer and what data is crucial for you. Adjust the folders and files you back up based on your specific needs and storage capacity.

Person: 
- They list "Application Data".  Is this the same as the AppData folder?  They list "User Data" which has a lot of the folders you see in the C Drive under the user.  How does this work?  Is this some logical folder that links to user files in the C Drive?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, the terms "Application Data" and "AppData" often refer to the same thing in the context of Windows operating systems. The AppData folder is a hidden directory within a user's profile that stores application-specific data, settings, and configuration files. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that applications maintain user preferences and other personalized information across sessions. The AppData folder itself is divided into three subfolders: 
1. **Roaming** : Contains data that can move with a user's profile between different computers in a networked environment. Applications store data here when they need to synchronize settings across machines for a user. 
2. **Local** : Stores data that is specific to a single computer. Data stored here is not moved with the user's profile across different computers. This is typically where larger, machine-specific cache files are kept. 
3. **LocalLow** : Similar to Local, but is specifically for low-integrity or security-restricted applications. This is often used by Internet Explorer or other applications running in a protected mode, where the application has limited permissions.

When backup software (or discussions about backups) mentions "User Data," it's referring to the collection of all data related to a specific user profile on the computer. This includes documents, pictures, music, desktop files, downloads, and indeed the AppData folder. This data is typically found under the `C:\Users\YourUsername` directory on a Windows system.

Here’s how it works: 
- The **C:\Users\YourUsername**  directory acts as the root for all user-specific data on your system. It’s not just a collection of files and folders but a structured way Windows organizes user data to support multi-user environments and to keep data segregated and secure. 
- Within this directory, **Application Data**  (AppData) holds application-specific preferences and settings, distinguishing between local, roaming, and low-integrity application data.
- Other folders under the user profile, like Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Desktop, are more straightforward, storing files exactly as you’ve placed them.

In essence, when you're setting up backups, backing up the entire user profile directory (which includes both "Application Data" and other user data like documents and media files) ensures you capture all personal data, preferences, and configurations specific to your user account on the computer. This comprehensive approach is ideal for personal backup strategies, as it ensures that your important files and the environment preferences are preserved.

Person: 
- The file explorer has some of these files though set up in a different way by default so that you don't have to go to the C Drive to find them.  How does that work?

ChatGPT: 
- The Windows File Explorer provides a more user-friendly way to access many of these important user folders without needing to navigate directly to their physical locations on the C: drive. This functionality is primarily facilitated through the use of special folder shortcuts, known as "Library" folders or "Quick access" links in more recent versions of Windows. These shortcuts provide easy access to commonly used folders like Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos, making it more convenient for users to find and manage their files.
### How It Works 
1. **Library Folders** : Libraries are collections of folders that can aggregate content from various locations, including network drives and external storage, and present them as a single folder view. This makes it easier to manage files spread across different locations. 
2. **Quick Access** : Introduced in Windows 10, Quick Access is an area in File Explorer that automatically shows frequently and recently opened files and folders. It also allows users to pin their favorite folders for easy access. 
3. **Special Folder Shortcuts** : Windows creates special shortcuts for folders like Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc., which appear in File Explorer. These are not just regular shortcuts but are integrated into the operating system to offer a consistent and easy-to-use way for users to access their data. 
4. **Shell Folders** : Windows uses a concept called Shell folders to represent these special folders. Each of these has a unique identifier that allows Windows to manage them separately from their physical location on the disk. This abstraction allows the operating system to present a consistent user interface, regardless of where the folders are physically stored or how they are redirected (for example, in a networked environment). 
5. **User Profile Redirection** : For ease of access and to support user profile mobility (like in domain environments where user profiles are loaded from a server), Windows allows the redirection of these special folders to different locations. Despite this redirection, the special folders still appear in their usual places in the File Explorer interface, thanks to the Shell folder system.
### Example: Accessing Documents

When you open the Documents folder through File Explorer, you're not directly navigating to `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents` in most cases. Instead, you're accessing a special shortcut that Windows interprets and directs to the correct physical location. This system ensures that even if the underlying storage architecture changes, or if the folder is redirected to a different location, the user's experience remains consistent.

This design choice by Microsoft is intended to simplify file management for users, allowing them to access their files quickly without understanding the underlying file system's complexity. It's a user experience enhancement that helps keep essential user data organized and accessible through a few simple clicks.
