This folder exists to store data for files that contain sensitive client-side data such as API keys, secrets, and PII.  When using this wiki, some plugins will autogenerate these files but may be missing older settings. Use this folder to paste in data if need be in the event that the wiki needs to be reestablished.  This means that new API keys and secrets will need to be generated or pasted back in from some password store.
