    - Talk with Wade Wells
        - Do you need SOC experience to be in GRC? Understanding the technical side from a SOC translates well to GRC. 
        - Do you need Docker and Kubernetes? Yes...you can set up environments at supersonic speed.  You can load in all sorts of tools without being limited by your OS. You can network a lot of cool stuff.
        - Docker is way easier to dive into than doing crazy virtualization
        - Getting a cyber job: network, network, network, and get a YouTube channel where you talk with other people in cyber.  Learn to use content tools.

        - In 2015, he gave a talk on cyber insurance - it will dictate security programs
        - Insurance was handing out cyber insurance like crazy
        - When NotPetya hit, it set a precedent for cyber insurance. Mondelez sued the insurance firm and it flipped things upside down to where insurance scrutinizes you when you get insurance.
        - [An Insider's Guide to Cyber-Insurance and Security Guarantees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFtchKxtGmc&t=171s&pp=ygUhamVyZW1pYWggZ3Jvc3NtYW4gY3liZXIgaW5zdXJhbmNl)
        - These companies are putting up high premiums because ransomware payouts are crazy high
        - Cyber Insurance is not a mitigation:
            - This insurance just helps you to deal with the incident.  
            - The issue with cyber insurance is that there's not enough smart assessment and maturity in the industry, so insurance policies are conditional are when they can apply.  You won't be able to have insurance unless you check certain boxes.
            - Security and GRC teams have to put in a lot of work to have a good policy and show the company's security posture

    - It's not a good look for PR
    - This is a big issue for stalkers and abusers because they don't need to have spouseware, spyware, or any malware since the OS can now do it

- UNC 5537 Snowflake Data Breach
    - Doing dark web scraping is a fool's errand.  It's not easy to to.
    - Dark web ecosystem: People gather logs, post them into forums, sell access to botnets with stealers, they repackage them and resell them, etc.
    - Flare and Spycloud are good
    - Traditional cred abuse detections - creds from browser and some other locations (files, docs, clipboard)
    - You can have detections for tools querying these sensitive file locations for the browser
    - Browser security and sensitive data: browser data is encrypted on the machine by default, and that data is queryable or obtained via the "data protection" (DP) API which can access the data in the SQLite database or the browser.  The issue is that the key for the DP API can be obtained by non-privileged users, so it sort of defeats the purpose.
    - T1555.003 - Creds from Web Browser
    - Mitigations: don't save creds in browsers, limit the browsers users can use if possible, and have detections made from the attack ID to detect the infostealers.

    - We need better threat hunting and an approach that assumes long-term compromise and exploitation
    - If we are improving and auditing, then we shouldn't have unadvanced threats on our systems for years on end
    - Ex: 150 people on govt COMM squadron with 10 of them being cyber.  There was no SOC.  Rather, the entirety of their work was reactive, patch management, and things like POAMs and inspection prep.  There was an MSP for multiple bases, but they only really worried about was connectivity and keeping things up.  
    - People trust AV and EDR much.
