    - Big budget does not equal easy security.  You still have to deliver on that budget.
    - Do you get more certs in the cyber market or lab it up?..It's kinda a quagmire right now. Lab it up honestly. Technical skills are huge right now, and publicly show the skills you have.
    - Do you learn vendor neutral stuff or specific ones? You can kick butt on specific stuff sure, but the general skills are still transferable. Firewall and email gateway stuff is transferable and the principles are similar.  However, cloud can differ widely.

    - MS RCE via Wifi that affects all versions of Windows
        - Patch was released, but there's no POC
        - Requires connection to the network via Wifi and using a specially crafted packet
        - Packet crafting exploits haven't been as common or popular nowadays
        - Scapy and Hping3 are the popular tools - Scapy was popular with people like Judy Nobak - FW bypass with packet back then
        - No auth as user, no access to filesystem or settings
        - Requires EvilTwin or Karma attacks to be on the same wireless network first
        - 8.8 CVE - really high for needing local network access
    - Flippers and RF stuff
        - We can do fox hounts with DF (directional find) tools
        - We can use multiple collection points to pinpoint on a larger scale
        - It costs a good bit of money and time to set this up

        - We could set up a HackRF with a flipper
    - Recall "recall"
        - They delayed Recall due to LOTS of pushback
        - "They are putting security above everything" - yeah right
        - What was Recall designed for?  Is this for early onset dementia, pentesters, or average users?
        - It's not an issue if you're doing it on a device without sensitive data
    - Privacy Anonymization is not easy
        - You can't just add a layer of abstraction between AI and the company to deanonymize data
        - Entity resolution is a thing and you can still likely get back to an identity without needing recognizable PII like emails and names
    - Emojis used for Discord facilitated C2
        - "BLOCK EMOJIS"
    - 165 orgs affected by Snowflake breach

            - Microsoft has announced new cybersecurity enhancements for Outlook personal email accounts as part of its 'Secure Future Initiative,' including the deprecation of basic authentication (username + password) by September 16, 2024.

        - Tabletop exercises are awesome - it's good that federal regulators are setting tone with this even without concrete regulations
        - GRC Pros know how good tabletop exercises are
        - BCDR tabletops are different - they are more mature
        - These new tabletops are grander are looking for the big problems
        - Tabletops can be to be optimize and find weakpoints or to get ideas - mature and immature IT teams can use them
        - Early 2025 will give us opportunities to have tabletops and playbooks based on lessons learned and experiences from these federal agencies and their current tabletops.  Most businesses have CIO or CISO and they can leverage the AI-related tabletops from CISA. CISOs need an opinion and position on AI.
        - When cloud came on the scene, there was no guidance. Don't be in absence of information with AI.
    - Keytronic breach from BlackBasta
        - 530 GB of stolen data
        - Interfered with business apps
        - PII data involved

        - A company was down for 2 weeks - 2 things you can use for budget and board: 
            - 1) 2 weeks of operations gone - daily revenue times time, and..
            - 2) Millions in damages (10s likely in bigger companies)
        - We don't want to be the next case study
    - New Linux malware is controlled through emojis sent from Discord
        - Anything can be a C2 if it can send data in and out of the environment

    - Talk with Wade Wells
        - Do you need SOC experience to be in GRC? Understanding the technical side from a SOC translates well to GRC. 
        - Do you need Docker and Kubernetes? Yes...you can set up environments at supersonic speed.  You can load in all sorts of tools without being limited by your OS. You can network a lot of cool stuff.
        - Docker is way easier to dive into than doing crazy virtualization
        - Getting a cyber job: network, network, network, and get a YouTube channel where you talk with other people in cyber.  Learn to use content tools.
        - TheHive, Yeti, and OpenCTI are good. Cortex is good for ticketing threat intel and stuff.
        - Tracelabs VM has good CTI tools
        - Mandiant has Flare and Threat Pursuit
    - Panera data breach

        - In 2015, he gave a talk on cyber insurance - it will dictate security programs
        - Insurance was handing out cyber insurance like crazy
        - When NotPetya hit, it set a precedent for cyber insurance. Mondelez sued the insurance firm and it flipped things upside down to where insurance scrutinizes you when you get insurance.

        - These companies are putting up high premiums because ransomware payouts are crazy high
        - Cyber Insurance is not a mitigation:
            - This insurance just helps you to deal with the incident.  
            - The issue with cyber insurance is that there's not enough smart assessment and maturity in the industry, so insurance policies are conditional are when they can apply.  You won't be able to have insurance unless you check certain boxes.
            - Security and GRC teams have to put in a lot of work to have a good policy and show the company's security posture

    - It's not a good look for PR
    - This is a big issue for stalkers and abusers because they don't need to have spouseware, spyware, or any malware since the OS can now do it
    - MS misled customers about the security of Copilot
    - Employers like to use stalkerware for employee monitoring
    - 
- UNC 5537 Snowflake Data Breach
    - Doing dark web scraping is a fool's errand.  It's not easy to to.
    - Dark web ecosystem: People gather logs, post them into forums, sell access to botnets with stealers, they repackage them and resell them, etc.
    - Flare and Spycloud are good
    - Traditional cred abuse detections - creds from browser and some other locations (files, docs, clipboard)
    - You can have detections for tools querying these sensitive file locations for the browser
    - Browser security and sensitive data: browser data is encrypted on the machine by default, and that data is queryable or obtained via the "data protection" (DP) API which can access the data in the SQLite database or the browser.  The issue is that the key for the DP API can be obtained by non-privileged users, so it sort of defeats the purpose.
    - T1555.003 - Creds from Web Browser
    - Mitigations: don't save creds in browsers, limit the browsers users can use if possible, and have detections made from the attack ID to detect the infostealers.

    - We need better threat hunting and an approach that assumes long-term compromise and exploitation
    - If we are improving and auditing, then we shouldn't have unadvanced threats on our systems for years on end
    - Ex: 150 people on govt COMM squadron with 10 of them being cyber.  There was no SOC.  Rather, the entirety of their work was reactive, patch management, and things like POAMs and inspection prep.  There was an MSP for multiple bases, but they only really worried about was connectivity and keeping things up.  
    - People trust AV and EDR much.

    - While the breach has allegedly exposed the data of over 560 million Ticketmaster users, the company states that they do not believe that the breach will have a material impact on the overall business operations or its financial condition.
    - According to the threat actor, they used credentials stolen using information-stealing malware to breach a Snowflake employee's ServiceNow account, which they used to exfiltrate information from the company. This information included unexpired auth tokens that could be used to create session tokens and access customer accounts to download data.
    - The threat actor claims that they used this method to steal data from other companies, including Anheuser-Busch, State Farm, Mitsubishi, Progressive, Neiman Marcus, Allstate, and Advance Auto Parts.
