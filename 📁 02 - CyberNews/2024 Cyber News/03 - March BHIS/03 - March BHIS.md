1. [NIST Releases Version 2.0 of Landmark Cybersecurity Framework | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework) 
	1. #NIST #CSF2 #KelliTarala
	2. Additions:
		1. Supply Chain risk
		2. How to apply for all org sizes
	3. Was this spurred by the 2021 executive order or was it always the plan?
		1. [Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity | The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) - 2021 #executiveorder #POTUS 
	4. Supply chain security - lots of SBOMs (software bill of material)
2. [The FCC has finally decreed that 25Mbps and 3Mbps are not ‚Äòbroadband‚Äô speed - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24101313/fcc-new-broadband-definition-100mbps-20mbps) 
	1. Is DSL and DSL-max still broadband?
		1. DSL can do multiple channels on same circuit to increase bandwidth, but lots of DSL wouldn't qualify as "broadband" anymore 
		2. #FCC #ISPs #DSL 
	2. We have minimum standards for electricity and water so we should for internet #KelliTarala 
	3. Starlink has brought options to people without terrestrial broadband
	4. Opens the door for rural development grant programs:
		1. [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Over $770 Million for Rural Infrastructure Projects During Investing in America Tour | USDA](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/02/21/biden-harris-administration-announces-over-770-million-rural) 
		2. Boondocks can have Stranza glass running down powerlines
		3. Allows you $10 a month for 100 up and down Gbps üòÑ
3. [Welcome to the Red Canary 2024 Threat Detection Report](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/)
	1. [2024ThreatDetectionReport_RedCanary.pdf](https://resource.redcanary.com/rs/003-YRU-314/images/2024ThreatDetectionReport_RedCanary.pdf?version=0)
	2. Attackers getting smarter about standing up cloud assets
	3. #RedCanary #StealerLogs 
	4. It gets confusing talking about threat intel when there's tons of different unique groups and affiliates of those groups 
	5. Hacking is an exceptionally organized crime domain
	6. Cookies:
		1. not initially for auth schemes
		2. Google turning off tracking cookies last year
		3. cookies and JWTs and session serialization all store signed crypto stuff.  Problem is cloud provider allowing refresh token behavior. Lots of providers invalidate sessions based on changes in context (fingerprints, IPs, etc) #ContiuousAuth #JWT #cookies 
		4. [What is Continuous Authentication? | Okta](https://www.okta.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-continuous-authentication/) 
		5. Session cookies live too long.  There should be a mandatory refresh period and if login from new device or location then invalidate. Costs money and time to do all that though.
		6. Continuous auth with session anomaly detection requires implementing algorithms and a whole system to organize and process the data 
		7. Lots of web tech used in ways they weren't meant to be used for
		8. #financeSec Continuous authentication useful and valuable in financial scenarios
	7. Stealer logs
		1. usually trading subscriptions, VPN logins, and crypto auth material
		2. found stealer log password from 2 years back that was still valid
	8. Remove reset MFA from help desk if you can
		1. generate alerts when MFA is reset
		2. If you can't stop it, then generate manual alerts
	9. Enabling refresh token for OAuth is not considered best practice
		1. [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice](https://oauth.net/2/oauth-best-practice/) 
	10. #SSO 
		1. Single sign-on is easy
		2. Single "sign-out" is HARD to detect
			1. auto-expiry and deleting tokens across apps is cumbersome
			2. lots of those parties have different views of how long sessions should last
			3. requires APIs and controls for each case
4. [NSA Releases Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies > National Security Agency/Central Security Service > Press Release View](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/)
	1. #NSA #DoD #CISA #CIS
	2. NSA missions:
		1. act defensively
		2. signal intelligence
		3. secure critical infrastructure 
	3. Shared responsibility - leaving that S3 bucket public is your "assets"
		1. #S3 
		2. You don't get as many warning through CLI, #Terraform , etc.
	4. For those going to the cloud, what's the responsibility? 
		1. CSPs aren't cyber insurance providers 
	5. This is how far behind the curve we are
	6. The ten strategies are covered in the following reports:

	7. Pay for a dedicated KMS
		1. Attacks won't be lateral towards you if you have one
	8. Governance advice for stale and hard-to-track cloud assets?
		1. #assetManagement #assetGovernance #assetDiscovery
		2. #CIS came out with governance for CIS controls in cloud
		3. How to address additional workloads and identities in cloud
		4. #GRC has to be a bit more technical to help hold teams accountable on this front
5. [The FTC and DOJ want it to be legal to fix McDonald‚Äôs ice cream machines - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24101023/ftc-doj-comment-dmca-ifixit-ice-cream-machines) 
	1. #FTC #DoJ #antitrust #copyright
	2. FTC and DoJ antitrust division filed comment with US copyright office for expanded exemption to copyright law for the right to repair certain devices.
	3. Exemptions to DMCA Section 1201 are issued every three years, as per the Register of Copyrights‚Äô recommendation. Prior¬†[exemptions](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747310/us-copyright-office-dmca-section-1201-exemption-rulemaking-report)¬†have been issued for jailbreaking cellphones and repairing certain parts of video game consoles. The FTC and DOJ are asking the Copyright Office to go a step further, extending the right to repair to ‚Äúcommercial and industrial equipment.‚Äù 
	4. The comment singles out four distinct categories that would benefit from DMCA exemptions: **commercial soft serve machines; proprietary diagnostic kits; programmable logic controllers; and enterprise IT**.
	5. The average estimated cost of ‚Äúunplanned manufacturing downtime‚Äù was $260,000 per hour, the comment notes, citing research from Public Knowledge and iFixit. As for soft serve machines, breakdowns can lead to $625 in lost sales each day.
	6. Business owners can‚Äôt legally fix them on their own or hire an independent technician to do so...takes about 90 days to fix them
	7. #cyberMeme develop stuxnet malware to fix all soft-serve machines and remove limitations
