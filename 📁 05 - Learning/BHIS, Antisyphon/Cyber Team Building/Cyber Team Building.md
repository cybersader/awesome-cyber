# How to Accelerate Finding and Professionally Developing Talented InfoSec Team Members | Kip Boyle
## Work on program, not in it
- Work on your program instead of in it #quotesCISO #quotesCyber
	- Your program and team need to have a multiplicative nature rather than additive.  They need to multiply the value of each other
- Focus on tasks only you can do - core competencies
	- Strategic goals, framework, and how your team will grow
	- Don't be in the trenches
- Delegate, delegate, delegate
	- Don't be a control freak

## The Goal
- Focus on strategic goals, framework, and how your team will grow rather than being in the trenches
## Delegation Technique and Tool
- Very effective and efficient
- Get important, recurring work off your plate
- Provides professional development

- Will get the recurring work off your plate
	- Need to be able to document and SOP the stuff if you can

- Gradually let go of tasks till you know delegate can do it well

- Retention Ideal #4:
	- Aggresively create learning and growth opportunities for your people by sending them to training, giving them a learning stipend, and sharing your network with them.

- View delegated tasks as decisions
	- Example of a decision:
		- Policy is required, but there's an exception approval process. MFA that you require for remote access, some people show up to ask for the exception. If this happens a lot this is something you can delegate.  
		- You're delegating the decision of "should this be approved or denied"

### Delegation Tree
- Tree to delegate decisions (I do - we do - you do????)
	- Start at bottom with the roots (sub-problems or sub-decisions)
		- Guide them along
		- Give them training and criteria for process
		- Have delegate give the recommendation or solution and the why, but I'll make the decision
	- Trunk
		- You make the decision, but before you tell people tell me so I can give a quick look
	- Branch
		- You're doing great
		- Make the decisions/solutions and be autonomous
		- Explain the decisions/solutions
		- Give me a report (daily, weekly, monthly, etc)
	- Leaf
		- Make the decision/solution, act on it, don't talk to me
		- If there's a major exception, then you can escalate to me

### When to Delegate
- Opportunity to grow and develop team members
- Task will recur in a similar form in the future
- You have enough time to delegate the job effectively
- Someone ready for skills, access, and responsibility
### Tool
- Top half is boilerplate
- Share with delegates.  Use company system, wiki, daily or weekly checkups, and project tracking to keep up.

## Process for I do, we do, you do
- I do. You watch. We talk. (OBS)
- You do. I watch. We talk. (Screen share, Zoom)
- You do. We talk (1:1 meetings)
