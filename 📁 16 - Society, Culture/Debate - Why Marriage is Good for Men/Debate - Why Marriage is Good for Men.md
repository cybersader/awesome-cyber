The question: Is marriage good for men?

## Pearl Davis Opener
- so marriage today is a bad deal for men meaning that it is more
- [04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=248)likely to not work out than it is to work out 51% of those that sign up for marriage are not in a better place out of a 100 men at least 50 are not getting a good deal essentially I would like to clarify that I am not talking about some religious sect I am talking about average Americans on top of that there's a huge legal risk you are facing as a man again I am not here to discuss the religious of the religiosity of marriage but I'm here to talk about the outcomes of marriage in 2024 as well as the legal ramifications for getting married I've interviewed over a thousand women and men on marriage and relationships and have been putting together a documentary on family court and I've found that most men have no idea what they they are signing up for when they get married marriage is objectively a bad deal for men in 2024 what I would consider a bad deal is where the risk out weighs the reward what I would consider a successful marriage is an obedient wife and staying together for a lifetime to put it simply men want sex silence and sandwiches from a woman they are attracted to unfortunately women are not offering that in
- [05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=307)2024 women have zero interest in being wives gen Z women rank men seventh on their priority list coming behind things like education travel and experiences Millennial women are not much better they rank men as fourth behind their careers education and finances I personally have interviewed over a thousand women from London to Miami to Vegas and even the suburbs of Chicago and I can tell you firsthand that most young women have no interest in being wives this can be shown by women's outcomes and choices many men like Trent have been married for years and have no idea what the dating Market is like for young people one out of three women have had an abortion in the United States one out of four women has an STD 90% of women have been on birth control at some point in their life 80% of sexually active women will contract HPV at some point in their lifetime the average woman is 5' 3 and 170 lbs on top of that men can never really know the sexual past of the woman they are marrying dating apps have made promiscuity more accessible and easier to hide women have a great incentive to lie about their sexual past the CDC reports that the
- [06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=368)average number of sexual partners for a woman is between four and eight but I can tell you from interviews that I have done that below 10 is considered low nowadays this is especially crazy considering once a woman has over five sexual partners she is less likely to have a stable marriage after women have had over 10 sexual partners the chance of a happy marriage drops to merely 14% only 3% of women report waiting for marriage for a religious reason a quarter of women have a mental illness over half of women between the ages of 18 to 29 have at least one tattoo the average woman has at least $26,000 worth of debt and on top of that young women are officially out cheating and outd drinking men that makes marrying a woman today a higher risk than times of the past but let's look at marriage what benefits are given to men in marriage a hundred years ago men would have gotten a debt-free virgin who gave him four plus children and was expected to obey him unfortunately now modern marriage is simply management the majority of women are not known to be obedient wives how do we know this from one we have phrases like it's cheaper to Keeper in
- [07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=430)happy wife happy life if women were so obedient and good wives why are all of the phrases focused on bending to the will of the woman on top of that we can look at Women's choices during marriage some common problems that I have found is that women gain a significant amount of weight in marriage on average women gained 24 lounds within the first 5 years of marriage it would be one thing if women were're giving men four plus children like they were a hundred years ago but on average women give men one to two children the other issue we have is sexless marriages when we look at the boomer generation a third of them are in sexless marriages how many me many men have reported that women stop sleeping with them after they have children how many men would sign up for marriage if they knew that they are no they no longer would have sex their wives would no longer have sex with them now while this is not the majority of those marriages that is still not insignificant men are not even guaranteed an in shaped wife who sleeps with them now let's talk about the legal ramifications of marriage and family for men I do not say this with a happy heart
- [08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=486)but there is simply no legal way to stop a woman who wants to divorce you from doing so my logic is quite simple when you pay people to do the wrong thing more people will do it even seemingly good people unfortunately men the divorce system heavily benefits women and the stats reflect that women file for divorce 70% of the time and 73% of the time the reason given is irreconcilable differences this does not make sense considering people date on average three years before marriage what difference what differences did you not notice in those three years this makes sense considering the rising body counts and how promiscuous women are going into marriage this is not only devastating to men but also deadly men are nine times more likely to commit suicide following a divorce child support is tied to Social Security in title 4D and if you cannot pay the government can take away your money money directly from your bank account ruin your credit score take away your even your fishing license take money directly from your paycheck and even throw you in jail the best interest of the child is a principle to ensure government policy Safeguard the rights
- [09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=545)and holistic needs of children it is standard used in family law to make decisions impacting a child in matters of adoption child custody Guardianship and visitation this principle means that any situation should be looked at from the child's point of view this sounds nice in theory but this law is weaponized against men all across this country that this means the best interest of the child even in cases where you are lied to about paternity for example in California if you were on the child's birth certificate after the age of two and you were lied to about paternity you were on the hook for child support for 16 years there are many ways that women weaponize the family court in order to drain resources from men but I'm going to list a couple I have seen I have seen temporary restraining orders set to separate fathers from children men can be kicked out of the house they pay for on a moment's notice with a restraining order in that time period between her filing it and going to court the mother can put the father on child support because technically she is spending more time with the children what is not considered is that the woman
- [10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=603)spent more time with the kids because she had not been letting the dad see them due to the restraining order this is not illegal for women to do and there is no punishment I interviewed one man in London who had spent over $100,000 fighting for his children and still had not seen them in two years. I interviewed another man whose wife was trying to transition his kid without his permission it took him 3 years and over $50,000 to get custody imagine if he did not have the money many men go into bankruptcy trying to fight for their children a case I covered in the state of Chicago a father had paid over a million dollars to his ex-wife during a divorce and was still thrown in jail because he could not keep up with his $10,000 a month payment the child support payment is calculated by current earnings so if a man loses his job which many do due to the stressed divorce he is still on the hook for child support even if he cannot afford the money child support is given based on the amount of time that children get
- [11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=660)with get with their that dads are given with the children and that women and women have incentive to not give men access to their children and reward are rewarded for doing so many F men in this process find themselves homeless because they cannot keep up with child support payments the loss of a child is one of the leading indicators of mental illness many men that I have interviewed have compared this to death losing a child is they would rather die than live a life without their children and the stats show that many men pick death over this reality another thing that most that most do not know is that family court is not based on evidence it's based on a balance of probabilities rather than Beyond a reasonable doubt this means it is easier for a man easier to allege that a man abused you in Family Court without evidence mainstream cases like Amber herd and Johnny Depp show just how easy it is for women to ruin a man's reputation with no evidence many times the women are actually given free resources from domestic abuse centers in order to assist women in this in many areas the courts have alleged that the definition of abuse has changed in the
- [12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=723)last 50 years to include things like emotional abuse Financial abuse and have also changed the definition of rape from force sex to sex without consent the problem you get when you change these definitions to be more broad is that women are allowed to say things like yelling is abuse and he did not let me spend $5,000 on my credit card therefore he is abusive I have seen cases where men were accused of raping a woman the first time they hooked up and they were married 10 years after women weaponized this against them men the problem you get with these definitions that are more broad that women are allowed to abuse the system as I said before losing a child is like death to a lot of men one area that we studied was veteran suicide 44 veterans a day commit suicide and over 400,000 men have died due to suicide in the last 25 years to put it into perspective since the Revolutionary War 650,000 have died in battle in 25 years we have hit 2third of that Terence pop has worked with Veterans for 15 years and through our personal research have found that 70% % of Veteran suicides have come in contact with family court in The Last 5 Years
- [13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=784)family court is literally killing men every day and nobody is talking about it on top of that fathers have to watch their mothers raise children in a way that sets up their children for a failure single mother homes account for 63% of Youth suicides 90% of the homeless in runaways and the majority of School shooters where single father homes Fair similar to two parents' homes homes I personally have interviewed men who had to watch a mother try to transition their kid and I had one case where another a mother 's new boyfriend had accusations of being a pedophile and there was nothing the man could do let's go over this again the upside is that men get a woman who has slept with at least four other men and maybe two children out of the deal on average the woman will be 170b and 53 odds are she at least likely has one tattoo some debt and maybe even a previous child in tow the downside is you can lose half your assets your children your reputation homelessness and you can be put on child support alimony and even thrown in jail personally I would never sign a business deal that encourages that kind of risk but for whatever reason men are
- [14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=843)encouraged to sign a business deal that does 

## Trent Horn Opener
- all right well Pearl has the burden of showing that marriage is a bad deal for men and all I have to do is show that she hasn't made case and notice in Pearl's opening statement she never cites a study of married men in general to see whether they think marriage is a bad deal so to show that she's wrong I'm going to point out three fallacies that Pearl makes in her arguments so first there's the wrong target fallacy for example Pearl talks about how marriage is a bad deal because men are sometimes mistreated in child custody cases that's not unique to marriage if you cohabit or even just hook up with a woman you can still father a child and deal with custody issues however marriage makes a man the presumed father of the child with natural rights unmarried fathers don't have even though unmarried fathers can
- [15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=907)still be liable to pay child support the children of unmarried men are 10 times more likely to be aborted and if the child does survive the pregnancy he's three to six times more likely to live in poverty the hazards of unmarried much less for married men another wrong target is women themselves Pearl says marriage is bad for men because modern women are worse than previous generations of women but that says nothing about marriage if modern women are good enough for hookups that can result in children or cohabiting relationships that superficially feel like marriage but are far more likely to fail then modern women are good enough for marriage which has less harms for men and pearl can't use these stats to dunk on women because men are also worse than previous generations Modern Men are just as promiscuous and are even more overweight than modern women a 2019 experience study found that men carry more credit auto and Mortgage Debt than women Millennial and gen Z men have weaker grip strength and make less money than older men did at their age Pearl has not shown that women are not good enough for men instead the data shows
- [16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=972)men and women are both in bad shape compared to previous generations but there's hope marriage is the best way for men and women to mature together and bring out the best in one another second there's the anecdote fallacy one sad story about a marriage does not show marriage itself is bad because for every sad story Pearl can bring up I can statistically bring up two to three good stories about happy marriages and there are many stories about sad sick lonely men who never marry Pearl cannot prove her case with anecdotes she needs actual data that proves married men are worse off than unmarried men but no such data exists even marriage Skeptics will only argue at best that marriage doesn't increase happiness they all agree that men marry are better off concerning health wealth and happiness than men who never marry if Pearl can't provide peer riew data to prove otherwise then her case fails third there's the comparison fallacy instead of stories involving the risks of marriage Pearl often times just points to the risks of marriage itself and says that's a good enough reason to not marry she says just as you wouldn't
- [17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1043)fly on a plane that has a 5% chance of crashing you shouldn't get married even if it has similar low odds of divorcing but you look but if you look at the worst outcomes of one choice while ignoring the worst outcomes of another Choice that's the comparison fallacy it's like someone who thinks driving is safer than flying because they only read a bunch of stories about plane crashes and never think about car crashes of course flying is far safer than driving and marriage is less risky than non-marriage you cannot compare the best outcomes of non-marriage to the worst outcomes of marriage to be fair you must compare the typical outcomes in both cases be it flying versus driving or marriage versus non-marriage and pearl exaggerates the harms of marriage and ignores the harms of not marrying for example according to the National Center for Family and marriage research the median length of all marriages is not 7 to 8 years as Pearl often claims that's a length of marriages that end in divorce not all marriages the median length for all marriages is 21 years and the divorce rate is closer to 35% not 50% 50% was a future projection from the
- [18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1115)from the 80s that has since been falsified in fact we are now seeing the lowest divorce rates since 1970 about 14 divorces per 1,000 married women for weekly churchgoers the divorce rate is half the average rate also just because 35% of marriages end in divorce that doesn't mean you have a one in three chance of absolute misery divorce sucks but people typically survive it intact in fact men do better than women after divorce men's income increases by 20% on average while women are twice as likely to fall into poverty after divorce alimony is only paid out in less than 10% of divorces and according to the US Census Bureau the average child support payment is $441 a month of which only 60% usually ends up getting paid moreover women do not get child custody 90% of the time as others claim 95% of custody cases are mutually agreed upon outside of the courtroom women get full custody 40% of the time men get full custody 20% and shared custody makes up the remaining 40% women usually get full custody because men don't ask for it in a Massachusetts study of 24,000 divorces only 8% of men sought custody and 94% of
- [19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1193)them got full or partial custody finally a 2006 study in the Journal of epidemiology Community Health showed that while divorced men were 27% more likely to die prematurely 58% of never married men were more likely to die early never married men risk growing older and having few or no social connections Pearl can tell lots of horror stories apparently about men going through messy divorces and my wife who is a registered nurse can tell you all kinds of horror stories about men dying alone in the hospital spending every day by themselves staring at the same blotch on the the ceiling because they had no one to ever come and visit them now some men desire marriage and are unable to find a wife which is tragic but rejecting marriage out of fear is like the person who refuses to go to the hospital because he worries about medical errors but doesn't think about people dying at home from easily treatable illnesses the comparison fallacy once again that's probably why 65% of divorced men get remarried 93% of men say they would marry their spouse again if they could do marriage over if
- [21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1261)Pearl is right as she said in the past that marriage is a death sentence for men then why do most men voluntarily go back to death row after they've been released I.E divorced well it's because these men correctly identify what Pearl has failed to grasp marriage is not bad for men it's not a bad deal for men in fact marriage is typically a good deal for men it's no wonder God told Adam in the Book of Genesis it's not good for man to be alone and so he made Eve to remedy this problem now to make it clear it is a lie that half of all marriages end in divorce the truth is that most marriages last a lifetime and 80 to 90% of them identify as happy a Gallup survey conducted between 2008 and 2020 of 800,000 adults showed that married people rate their well-being 12 to 17 points higher than unmarried people the General Social Survey from the University of Chicago a gold standard in sociological research shows that married men are twice as likely to raise their lives as very happy when compared to non-married men and the majority of married men fact I'd say 80% of them identify themselves as happy married men also make 10 to 20%
- [22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1329)more money per hour and they have more sex than never married men Pearl says that men face sexless marriages but the General Social Survey shows that unmarried men are twice as likely to have a sexless life than a married man studies also show that even men who end up divorced live longer are economically better off and are just as or even happier than never married men now Pearl might say these studies only prove that happier richer men get married and unhappy poor men don't get married but when you look at the typical married man he is not a 6'2 in Rich Chad moreover if a man chooses to marry then he needs to become marriageable which involves developing positive traits that both make him desirable to women and improve his own self-esteem at the same time but I'm not arguing that marriage makes people happy I'm arguing against Pearl's claim that marriage is a bad deal for men and steals their happiness that's just not true in fact marriage is the best way for men to not just hang on
- [23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1393)to happiness but to increase it the Harvard study of adult development which tracked people for 80 years said good relationships were the number one predictor of happiness and it showed that men who married ended up happier and lived 7 to 17 years longer than men who never married and that's a study for people over 80 years of their life when I was unmarried let me actually go through here well yeah when I was unmarried I thought that having two folding chairs and a TV on the ground were appropriate living room furniture but when you're married your wife shows you something better and she roots for you a 2013 Harvard study showed that married men are less likely to get cancer and married men are even more likely to survive cancer showing that marriage is a good deal for men so finally I'd be remiss to point out neither men nor women invented marriage God invented marriage he gave it to the human race Christ Christ raised it to the level of a Sacrament and pearl would have to give overwhelming data to show that something that God gave us is actually a bad deal for men and she won't be able to do that
- [24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1454)because the data doesn't support that indeed for most men marriage is the primary engine that helps them live a long healthy and happy life 

## Pearl Rebuttal
- one second one thing I noticed in your arguments is that you constantly attribute all of the positive things that happen in marriage you just automatically attribute them to women you automatically attribute them to that marriage is the cause I would disagree with that I would say it's a bad deal because at the end of the day women are paid to leave you you never addressed any solutions that you have what Solutions
- [25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1522)does the church have women don't want to be married men cannot make women married that do not want to be married women are getting STDs women are getting abortions the majority of women today are not marriageable they're overweight they're out of shape and you know saying that marriage is good isn't going to change that isn't going to make women want to be wives you know the next thing that I noticed that you said was that unmarried men are more likely to have a sexless life obviously obviously um you know men that cannot attract women obviously are not duh um and you never address that men are nine times more likely to commit suicide after marriage you know even even if it's a 5% you know one out of 50 even if it's a one out of 50 chance or one out of a 100 chance that you commit suicide you know that's negligible that's negligence you know any any car would be recalled if 1% of people died um I I just think at the end of the day that I would never sign a deal that one party is paid to leave and you're not
- [26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1595)addressing the lack of quality of women that are on the market today men cannot make women want to be wives um and if women don't want to be wives basically you're just you're not going to it's not going to happen the other thing is that you know if marriage is such a good deal why aren't men signing up good products technically they get off the market it quickly men naturally they they want to do things that make sense and the issue that you're you're going to get is that again the quality of women is lower than ever before the cost of marriage is higher than ever before and until that changes until some of the laws change it is just not a good deal for men
## Trent Rebuttal
- you have a 5 minute rebuttal Trent whenever you want to begin sure if you want that you're welcome ready all right go for it all right so I want to focus on one very clear fact that refutes Pearl's case that she has not cited any studies looking at men and seeing what do they think I mean if marriage is such a bad deal for men we don't need Pearl to tell us that why
- [27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1673)don't we just ask men themselves men are ask married men were you given a bad deal were you given a raw deal you go online you go to Amazon you go to other kinds of places you can see people write product reviews and saying whether they got a bad deal out of something and you should probably trust someone who actually tried the product and wrote a review instead of someone writing a reviews about a product they've never tried before and I've already shown the data that married men identify as being more happier than unmarried men they live longer they're healthier so marriage is a good deal for them it certainly isn't a bad deal for them they get many benefits out of that and pearl has not refuted that all she's been reduced to saying is that marriage is a bad deal for men because apparently women aren't worth marrying which is just not true she's pointing out flaws in women but she gives a pass to men it's a kind of reverse form of simping if you will because men also fall under this so let's talk about some of the things that she brought up uh about the issues of being sexless saying that 20% of marriages are sexless uh that's only
- [28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1738)if you include senior citizens in the entire framework as I said the General Social Survey shows that unmarried men are twice as likely to be sexist as married men so if you're a guy and if that's something that is important to you in your life marriage is the Covenant through which sex makes the most sense you have the most access to it and it's the safest and best thing for you and for the children that will proceed from your union she made a big deal about weight uh women are overweight women gain 20 LBS in marriage she's probably referring to the Gordon Larsson 2009 study on that but that same study showed that married men gain 30 LBS over the same period unmarried cohabiting women gain 18 pounds during that women during that period and single women gain 15 pounds during that women during that period so all that proves is as we get older instead of growing up we tend to grow out that's just life and it's nice as you get married to have someone else to grow up and out with with you and mature people recognize that and don't just reject marriage because of a biological fact of reality uh women don't want to be wives I
- [30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1805)there's no evidence Pearl gave to support that conclusion I at least I can look at anecdotally uh I can think about it in your own life how many times have you heard a girl lament that her boyfriend she'd love to get married but her boyfriend doesn't want to get married or he's dragging his feet how many times have you can't interrupt him till the time is over uh how many times have you heard a guy say oh I really wish I could get married but my girlfriend's just dragging her feet uh women are the ones women control access to be put it crudely women control access to sex and Men control access to marriage that's how it's worked traditionally and it still works today uh Pearl asked uh if marriage is such a good deal why aren't women signing up why aren't men and women signing up for it well that's like asking if exercise is good for you why don't more people go to the gym why is the gym usually empty it's because marriage is hard you have to say no to a lot of things as as a man if you choose to get married you have to say no to things your little lizard brain tells you are good like trying to hook up with
- [31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1863)as many women as possible so people may not probably don't sign up for it because they don't realize the benefits and they listen to the lower part of the brain instead of the rational part of the brain that could read studies covering hundreds of thousands of men showing that they're happier live longer and have more sustaining fulfilled lives than being unmarried so um some of the things that yeah when when Pearl brings up oh that men are divorced men are nine times more likely to commit suicide she's probably referring to the Kippo Osa 2003 study it's not that that's not men are nine times more likely to commit suicide who are divorced they're nine times more like divorced men are nine times more likely to commit suicide than divorced women but that's only because men are just more likely to complete suicide anyways than women they tend to choose more violent means to do it so but when you look at the data never married men are still just as if not more likely to commit suicide than never than divorced men so that's the comparison fallacy once again you talk about all the risks related to marriage and there are risks but there are
- [32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1928)greater risks to being not married so that shows marriage is not a m bad deal and as I said before if marriage is such a bad deal for men if it's so bad why do 93% of men say they're willing to remarry their wives again if they had the chance why do 65% of divorced men choose and go and get remarried it's because they recognize maybe someone wasn't right for them but marriage was still right for them all right so we're going to take a quick break and then when we come back we're going to have cross-examination and PE you'll have 20 minutes to drill Trent with questions follow up whatever you want to follow up on and then Trent you'll have 20 minutes so if you're watching right now please stick around let us know how you think this debate is going in the live chat and we'll be right back I want to tell you about a course that I have created for men to overcome pornography it is called strive 21.com slat you go there right right now or if you text strive to 66866 we'll send you the link it's 100% free and it's a course I've created to help men to give them the tools to overcome pornography usually men know
## Pearl Cross-Examines Trent
- [35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2141)so we are going to go into a time of 20 minute cross- examine and I'm going to explain what it is for our viewers okay so Pearl's going to begin and in Cross examine she is free to lead the discussion however she wishes she is welcome to interrupt Trant to redirect direct Trent however she pleases uh this is her time so it's not considered rude if she does that and vice versa when when Trent does that so um let's see whenever you're ready Pearl you can begin with your 20 minutes one second and if you'd like I can let you know when you have 3 minutes left or something okay one second okay no worries take your time do you think that women should be obedient to their

- [37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2250)wellbeing what about health what about health I think it's I think it's good for husbands and wives want each other to be healthy I'm asking the husb why do you always bring it back to the husband because I'm asking about the wife I didn't ask you about the husband I'm saying I'm saying for the husband is he can he ask that his wife stays a certain weight is that rational it's rational for him to ask her to be healthy but staying at a certain weight your entire life that's not necessarily going to be healthy like saying oh I want you to always be 12 pounds like hey I got pregnant oh kind of getting past that now I don't like that that's that would be irrational that would so that would he would not be allowed to do that under your I your thought I think it would be insane if a man said that his wife needs to stay a certain why why like what's wrong with men having standards what's wrong with that Pearl you do realize that that's absolutely like literally there was a joke in the office where BJ Novak says some supermodels lose weight when they're pregnant that shows that he's just an insane chauvinistic person to demand that a stay at a certain
- [38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2308)weight even though as you get older you naturally gain weight and especially when you get pregnant you gain at least ounds of weight that would be insane to demand someone their certain weight women lose it all the time I fail to see how any of this is relevant to marriage by the way well I'm what I'm trying to understand is your mindset so so why why can't men have standards in marriage because if you're saying that men can't have standards in their own marriage like this this is this is the well you're saying it's irrational for a to demand his wife stay a certain weight why why is that wrong to stay a certain weight during their entire marriage why why is that wrong because I've seen women do it would you like me to answer the question go ahead okay because biologically we our bodies change over time they'll naturally gain and lose weight in different circumstances and your worth as a spouse whether you are a husband or a wife is not derived by your weight that's just a shallow thing now I think that both husbands and wives should encourage it's your job to be attrative I think husbands and wives should both maintain
- [39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2372)attractive but why do you always like why do you always have to bring it back CU why do you only focus on now right now because we're asking about the deal for men so I'm looking at this from the man's point of view what does the man get out of it is this a good deal he can't even ask for an inshape wife he gets a woman he can't even say question can I can I can I answer the question I'm asking ask he gets a woman who's promised to stay with him even though statistically he'll gain 30 or 40 lb and and that wom women women's job has far more of a job to be beautiful than men you know men's job is to protect and provide so do women do women what is wrong with a man asking that she stays a certain weight cuz it's cuz it's shallow it's fine to ask someone to be healthy and it's fine to encourage your spouse to maintain attractiveness not to just let yourself go but that's the same for husbands and wives neither should just let themselves go but at the same time each one should each one should be merciful knowing that time and Age come for all of us the reason that the Obesity I've looked that up before the reason that o the men are more
- [40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2441)overweight than women is because you includeed you don't look at visceral fat so like when men are a high very high like muscle percentage they're still considered overweight more so than women so a more accurate way to look at that is visceral fat and women have higher rates of visceral fat than men so actually women are more and if you look at extreme obesity women are more obese so yeah so I don't know why you're like kind of lying with that stat trying to act like men are equally obese they're not well men are men are still overweight but that still doesn't that still doesn't show none of that shows marriage is a bad deal for question should men marry women that have had abortions should men marry women that have had abortions should men marry women that have had abortions I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker should men marry women with STDs I wouldn't say here quarter of women have herpes should men marry them I'm going to answer I would like to answer your question just I would say just as it is not a disqualifier for if a man facilitated an abortion and 90% of so for every woman who chooses to get an abortion 90% of
- [41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2502)the time the man is actively or passively supporting it so just as it's not a deal breaker for a woman I'm asking for the future man I'm not saying this that he asked her to abort his this is another man's kid she's had an abortion no what I'm saying is I'm applying an equal standard here so I would say that it is not a deal breaker for a man to marry a woman who's had an abortion just like it's not a deal breaker for a woman to marry a man who had facilitated an abortion should men marry women that have slept with over 10 men should they marry someone who's slept with over 10 men I would say that when you have more sexual partners that's definitely a that's something that's concerning that could be a red flag but that but that doesn't apply I'm not going to say that someone is unmarriageable because of one particular trait what about porn okay what what what about women that have that have participated in porn should men marry women that have participated in porn I would say that that's definitely a red flag but it is not a necessarily it's not a deal breaker I can can I answer the questions pear because you can keep
- [42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2561)asking questions and I'll never answer it just would be easier if I got a yes or no because you keep giving me these roundabout and I'm just yes or no no I'm giving you good answers okay so I'd like to finish about prnography I would say it's not a deal breaker if a woman had participated in pornography uh much the same way it is not a deal breaker well it's something to be very very worried about so I'll answer it this way I it's very hard me to find anything that's a deal breaker for marriage except for maybe diagnosed uh severe mental illness for example um or addiction to drugs things like that but that would apply to men and women so when it comes to pornography I would say it's very concerning if you have if a woman had previously engaged in pornography just like it is very concerning if a woman chooses to marry a man who's previously viewed pornography but this is my question it's like why can't men have standards and and this is what I've noticed from the Trad community and like the conservatives it's like the quality of women keeps going down and down and down and we can't even definitively say hey maybe we
