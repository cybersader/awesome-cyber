- so marriage today is a bad deal for men meaning that it is more
- [04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=248)likely to not work out than it is to work out 51% of those that sign up for marriage are not in a better place out of a 100 men at least 50 are not getting a good deal essentially I would like to clarify that I am not talking about some religious sect I am talking about average Americans on top of that there's a huge legal risk you are facing as a man again I am not here to discuss the religious of the religiosity of marriage but I'm here to talk about the outcomes of marriage in 2024 as well as the legal ramifications for getting married I've interviewed over a thousand women and men on marriage and relationships and have been putting together a documentary on family court and I've found that most men have no idea what they they are signing up for when they get married marriage is objectively a bad deal for men in 2024 what I would consider a bad deal is where the risk out weighs the reward what I would consider a successful marriage is an obedient wife and staying together for a lifetime to put it simply men want sex silence and sandwiches from a woman they are attracted to unfortunately women are not offering that in
- [05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=307)2024 women have zero interest in being wives gen Z women rank men seventh on their priority list coming behind things like education travel and experiences Millennial women are not much better they rank men as fourth behind their careers education and finances I personally have interviewed over a thousand women from London to Miami to Vegas and even the suburbs of Chicago and I can tell you firsthand that most young women have no interest in being wives this can be shown by women's outcomes and choices many men like Trent have been married for years and have no idea what the dating Market is like for young people one out of three women have had an abortion in the United States one out of four women has an STD 90% of women have been on birth control at some point in their life 80% of sexually active women will contract HPV at some point in their lifetime the average woman is 5' 3 and 170 lbs on top of that men can never really know the sexual past of the woman they are marrying dating apps have made promiscuity more accessible and easier to hide women have a great incentive to lie about their sexual past the CDC reports that the
- [06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=368)average number of sexual partners for a woman is between four and eight but I can tell you from interviews that I have done that below 10 is considered low nowadays this is especially crazy considering once a woman has over five sexual partners she is less likely to have a stable marriage after women have had over 10 sexual partners the chance of a happy marriage drops to merely 14% only 3% of women report waiting for marriage for a religious reason a quarter of women have a mental illness over half of women between the ages of 18 to 29 have at least one tattoo the average woman has at least $26,000 worth of debt and on top of that young women are officially out cheating and outd drinking men that makes marrying a woman today a higher risk than times of the past but let's look at marriage what benefits are given to men in marriage a hundred years ago men would have gotten a debt-free virgin who gave him four plus children and was expected to obey him unfortunately now modern marriage is simply management the majority of women are not known to be obedient wives how do we know this from one we have phrases like it's cheaper to Keeper in
- [07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=430)happy wife happy life if women were so obedient and good wives why are all of the phrases focused on bending to the will of the woman on top of that we can look at Women's choices during marriage some common problems that I have found is that women gain a significant amount of weight in marriage on average women gained 24 lounds within the first 5 years of marriage it would be one thing if women were're giving men four plus children like they were a hundred years ago but on average women give men one to two children the other issue we have is sexless marriages when we look at the boomer generation a third of them are in sexless marriages how many me many men have reported that women stop sleeping with them after they have children how many men would sign up for marriage if they knew that they are no they no longer would have sex their wives would no longer have sex with them now while this is not the majority of those marriages that is still not insignificant men are not even guaranteed an in shaped wife who sleeps with them now let's talk about the legal ramifications of marriage and family for men I do not say this with a happy heart
- [08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=486)but there is simply no legal way to stop a woman who wants to divorce you from doing so my logic is quite simple when you pay people to do the wrong thing more people will do it even seemingly good people unfortunately men the divorce system heavily benefits women and the stats reflect that women file for divorce 70% of the time and 73% of the time the reason given is irreconcilable differences this does not make sense considering people date on average three years before marriage what difference what differences did you not notice in those three years this makes sense considering the rising body counts and how promiscuous women are going into marriage this is not only devastating to men but also deadly men are nine times more likely to commit suicide following a divorce child support is tied to Social Security in title 4D and if you cannot pay the government can take away your money money directly from your bank account ruin your credit score take away your even your fishing license take money directly from your paycheck and even throw you in jail the best interest of the child is a principle to ensure government policy Safeguard the rights
- [09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=545)and holistic needs of children it is standard used in family law to make decisions impacting a child in matters of adoption child custody Guardianship and visitation this principle means that any situation should be looked at from the child's point of view this sounds nice in theory but this law is weaponized against men all across this country that this means the best interest of the child even in cases where you are lied to about paternity for example in California if you were on the child's birth certificate after the age of two and you were lied to about paternity you were on the hook for child support for 16 years there are many ways that women weaponize the family court in order to drain resources from men but I'm going to list a couple I have seen I have seen temporary restraining orders set to separate fathers from children men can be kicked out of the house they pay for on a moment's notice with a restraining order in that time period between her filing it and going to court the mother can put the father on child support because technically she is spending more time with the children what is not considered is that the woman
- [10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=603) spent more time with the kids because she had not been letting the dad see them due to the restraining order this is not illegal for women to do and there is no punishment I interviewed one man in London who had spent over $100,000 fighting for his children and still had not seen them in two years. I interviewed another man whose wife was trying to transition his kid without his permission it took him 3 years and over $50,000 to get custody imagine if he did not have the money many men go into bankruptcy trying to fight for their children a case I covered in the state of Chicago a father had paid over a million dollars to his ex-wife during a divorce and was still thrown in jail because he could not keep up with his $10,000 a month payment the child support payment is calculated by current earnings so if a man loses his job which many do due to the stressed divorce he is still on the hook for child support even if he cannot afford the money child support is given based on the amount of time that children get
- [11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=660) with get with their that dads are given with the children and that women and women have incentive to not give men access to their children and reward are rewarded for doing so many F men in this process find themselves homeless because they cannot keep up with child support payments the loss of a child is one of the leading indicators of mental illness many men that I have interviewed have compared this to death losing a child is they would rather die than live a life without their children and the stats show that many men pick death over this reality another thing that most that most do not know is that family court is not based on evidence it's based on a balance of probabilities rather than Beyond a reasonable doubt this means it is easier for a man easier to allege that a man abused you in Family Court without evidence mainstream cases like Amber herd and Johnny Depp show just how easy it is for women to ruin a man's reputation with no evidence many times the women are actually given free resources from domestic abuse centers in order to assist women in this in many areas the courts have alleged that the definition of abuse has changed in the
- [12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=723)last 50 years to include things like emotional abuse Financial abuse and have also changed the definition of rape from force sex to sex without consent the problem you get when you change these definitions to be more broad is that women are allowed to say things like yelling is abuse and he did not let me spend $5,000 on my credit card therefore he is abusive I have seen cases where men were accused of raping a woman the first time they hooked up and they were married 10 years after women weaponized this against them men the problem you get with these definitions that are more broad that women are allowed to abuse the system as I said before losing a child is like death to a lot of men one area that we studied was veteran suicide 44 veterans a day commit suicide and over 400,000 men have died due to suicide in the last 25 years to put it into perspective since the Revolutionary War 650,000 have died in battle in 25 years we have hit 2third of that Terence pop has worked with Veterans for 15 years and through our personal research have found that 70% % of Veteran suicides have come in contact with family court in The Last 5 Years
- [13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=784)family court is literally killing men every day and nobody is talking about it on top of that fathers have to watch their mothers raise children in a way that sets up their children for a failure single mother homes account for 63% of Youth suicides 90% of the homeless in runaways and the majority of School shooters where single father homes Fair similar to two parents' homes homes I personally have interviewed men who had to watch a mother try to transition their kid and I had one case where another a mother 's new boyfriend had accusations of being a pedophile and there was nothing the man could do let's go over this again the upside is that men get a woman who has slept with at least four other men and maybe two children out of the deal on average the woman will be 170b and 53 odds are she at least likely has one tattoo some debt and maybe even a previous child in tow the downside is you can lose half your assets your children your reputation homelessness and you can be put on child support alimony and even thrown in jail personally I would never sign a business deal that encourages that kind of risk but for whatever reason men are

## Trent Horn Opener
- all right well Pearl has the burden of showing that marriage is a bad deal for men and all I have to do is show that she hasn't made case and notice in Pearl's opening statement she never cites a study of married men in general to see whether they think marriage is a bad deal so to show that she's wrong I'm going to point out three fallacies that Pearl makes in her arguments so first there's the wrong target fallacy for example Pearl talks about how marriage is a bad deal because men are sometimes mistreated in child custody cases that's not unique to marriage if you cohabit or even just hook up with a woman you can still father a child and deal with custody issues however marriage makes a man the presumed father of the child with natural rights unmarried fathers don't have even though unmarried fathers can
- [15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=907)still be liable to pay child support the children of unmarried men are 10 times more likely to be aborted and if the child does survive the pregnancy he's three to six times more likely to live in poverty the hazards of unmarried much less for married men another wrong target is women themselves Pearl says marriage is bad for men because modern women are worse than previous generations of women but that says nothing about marriage if modern women are good enough for hookups that can result in children or cohabiting relationships that superficially feel like marriage but are far more likely to fail then modern women are good enough for marriage which has less harms for men and pearl can't use these stats to dunk on women because men are also worse than previous generations Modern Men are just as promiscuous and are even more overweight than modern women a 2019 experience study found that men carry more credit auto and Mortgage Debt than women Millennial and gen Z men have weaker grip strength and make less money than older men did at their age Pearl has not shown that women are not good enough for men instead the data shows
- [16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=972)men and women are both in bad shape compared to previous generations but there's hope marriage is the best way for men and women to mature together and bring out the best in one another second there's the anecdote fallacy one sad story about a marriage does not show marriage itself is bad because for every sad story Pearl can bring up I can statistically bring up two to three good stories about happy marriages and there are many stories about sad sick lonely men who never marry Pearl cannot prove her case with anecdotes she needs actual data that proves married men are worse off than unmarried men but no such data exists even marriage Skeptics will only argue at best that marriage doesn't increase happiness they all agree that men marry are better off concerning health wealth and happiness than men who never marry if Pearl can't provide peer riew data to prove otherwise then her case fails third there's the comparison fallacy instead of stories involving the risks of marriage Pearl often times just points to the risks of marriage itself and says that's a good enough reason to not marry she says just as you wouldn't
- [17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1043)fly on a plane that has a 5% chance of crashing you shouldn't get married even if it has similar low odds of divorcing but you look but if you look at the worst outcomes of one choice while ignoring the worst outcomes of another Choice that's the comparison fallacy it's like someone who thinks driving is safer than flying because they only read a bunch of stories about plane crashes and never think about car crashes of course flying is far safer than driving and marriage is less risky than non-marriage you cannot compare the best outcomes of non-marriage to the worst outcomes of marriage to be fair you must compare the typical outcomes in both cases be it flying versus driving or marriage versus non-marriage and pearl exaggerates the harms of marriage and ignores the harms of not marrying for example according to the National Center for Family and marriage research the median length of all marriages is not 7 to 8 years as Pearl often claims that's a length of marriages that end in divorce not all marriages the median length for all marriages is 21 years and the divorce rate is closer to 35% not 50% 50% was a future projection from the
- [18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1115)from the 80s that has since been falsified in fact we are now seeing the lowest divorce rates since 1970 about 14 divorces per 1,000 married women for weekly churchgoers the divorce rate is half the average rate also just because 35% of marriages end in divorce that doesn't mean you have a one in three chance of absolute misery divorce sucks but people typically survive it intact in fact men do better than women after divorce men's income increases by 20% on average while women are twice as likely to fall into poverty after divorce alimony is only paid out in less than 10% of divorces and according to the US Census Bureau the average child support payment is $441 a month of which only 60% usually ends up getting paid moreover women do not get child custody 90% of the time as others claim 95% of custody cases are mutually agreed upon outside of the courtroom women get full custody 40% of the time men get full custody 20% and shared custody makes up the remaining 40% women usually get full custody because men don't ask for it in a Massachusetts study of 24,000 divorces only 8% of men sought custody and 94% of
- [19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1193)them got full or partial custody finally a 2006 study in the Journal of epidemiology Community Health showed that while divorced men were 27% more likely to die prematurely 58% of never married men were more likely to die early never married men risk growing older and having few or no social connections Pearl can tell lots of horror stories apparently about men going through messy divorces and my wife who is a registered nurse can tell you all kinds of horror stories about men dying alone in the hospital spending every day by themselves staring at the same blotch on the the ceiling because they had no one to ever come and visit them now some men desire marriage and are unable to find a wife which is tragic but rejecting marriage out of fear is like the person who refuses to go to the hospital because he worries about medical errors but doesn't think about people dying at home from easily treatable illnesses the comparison fallacy once again that's probably why 65% of divorced men get remarried 93% of men say they would marry their spouse again if they could do marriage over if
- [21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1261)Pearl is right as she said in the past that marriage is a death sentence for men then why do most men voluntarily go back to death row after they've been released I.E divorced well it's because these men correctly identify what Pearl has failed to grasp marriage is not bad for men it's not a bad deal for men in fact marriage is typically a good deal for men it's no wonder God told Adam in the Book of Genesis it's not good for man to be alone and so he made Eve to remedy this problem now to make it clear it is a lie that half of all marriages end in divorce the truth is that most marriages last a lifetime and 80 to 90% of them identify as happy a Gallup survey conducted between 2008 and 2020 of 800,000 adults showed that married people rate their well-being 12 to 17 points higher than unmarried people the General Social Survey from the University of Chicago a gold standard in sociological research shows that married men are twice as likely to raise their lives as very happy when compared to non-married men and the majority of married men fact I'd say 80% of them identify themselves as happy married men also make 10 to 20%
- [22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1329)more money per hour and they have more sex than never married men Pearl says that men face sexless marriages but the General Social Survey shows that unmarried men are twice as likely to have a sexless life than a married man studies also show that even men who end up divorced live longer are economically better off and are just as or even happier than never married men now Pearl might say these studies only prove that happier richer men get married and unhappy poor men don't get married but when you look at the typical married man he is not a 6'2 in Rich Chad moreover if a man chooses to marry then he needs to become marriageable which involves developing positive traits that both make him desirable to women and improve his own self-esteem at the same time but I'm not arguing that marriage makes people happy I'm arguing against Pearl's claim that marriage is a bad deal for men and steals their happiness that's just not true in fact marriage is the best way for men to not just hang on
- [23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1393)to happiness but to increase it the Harvard study of adult development which tracked people for 80 years said good relationships were the number one predictor of happiness and it showed that men who married ended up happier and lived 7 to 17 years longer than men who never married and that's a study for people over 80 years of their life when I was unmarried let me actually go through here well yeah when I was unmarried I thought that having two folding chairs and a TV on the ground were appropriate living room furniture but when you're married your wife shows you something better and she roots for you a 2013 Harvard study showed that married men are less likely to get cancer and married men are even more likely to survive cancer showing that marriage is a good deal for men so finally I'd be remiss to point out neither men nor women invented marriage God invented marriage he gave it to the human race Christ Christ raised it to the level of a Sacrament and pearl would have to give overwhelming data to show that something that God gave us is actually a bad deal for men and she won't be able to do that
- [24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1454)because the data doesn't support that indeed for most men marriage is the primary engine that helps them live a long healthy and happy life 

## Pearl Rebuttal
- one second one thing I noticed in your arguments is that you constantly attribute all of the positive things that happen in marriage you just automatically attribute them to women you automatically attribute them to that marriage is the cause I would disagree with that I would say it's a bad deal because at the end of the day women are paid to leave you you never addressed any solutions that you have what Solutions
- [25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1522)does the church have women don't want to be married men cannot make women married that do not want to be married women are getting STDs women are getting abortions the majority of women today are not marriageable they're overweight they're out of shape and you know saying that marriage is good isn't going to change that isn't going to make women want to be wives you know the next thing that I noticed that you said was that unmarried men are more likely to have a sexless life obviously obviously um you know men that cannot attract women obviously are not duh um and you never address that men are nine times more likely to commit suicide after marriage you know even even if it's a 5% you know one out of 50 even if it's a one out of 50 chance or one out of a 100 chance that you commit suicide you know that's negligible that's negligence you know any any car would be recalled if 1% of people died um I I just think at the end of the day that I would never sign a deal that one party is paid to leave and you're not
- [26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1595)addressing the lack of quality of women that are on the market today men cannot make women want to be wives um and if women don't want to be wives basically you're just you're not going to it's not going to happen the other thing is that you know if marriage is such a good deal why aren't men signing up good products technically they get off the market it quickly men naturally they they want to do things that make sense and the issue that you're you're going to get is that again the quality of women is lower than ever before the cost of marriage is higher than ever before and until that changes until some of the laws change it is just not a good deal for men
## Trent Rebuttal
- you have a 5 minute rebuttal Trent whenever you want to begin sure if you want that you're welcome ready all right go for it all right so I want to focus on one very clear fact that refutes Pearl's case that she has not cited any studies looking at men and seeing what do they think I mean if marriage is such a bad deal for men we don't need Pearl to tell us that why
- [27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1673)don't we just ask men themselves men are ask married men were you given a bad deal were you given a raw deal you go online you go to Amazon you go to other kinds of places you can see people write product reviews and saying whether they got a bad deal out of something and you should probably trust someone who actually tried the product and wrote a review instead of someone writing a reviews about a product they've never tried before and I've already shown the data that married men identify as being more happier than unmarried men they live longer they're healthier so marriage is a good deal for them it certainly isn't a bad deal for them they get many benefits out of that and pearl has not refuted that all she's been reduced to saying is that marriage is a bad deal for men because apparently women aren't worth marrying which is just not true she's pointing out flaws in women but she gives a pass to men it's a kind of reverse form of simping if you will because men also fall under this so let's talk about some of the things that she brought up uh about the issues of being sexless saying that 20% of marriages are sexless uh that's only
- [28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1738)if you include senior citizens in the entire framework as I said the General Social Survey shows that unmarried men are twice as likely to be sexist as married men so if you're a guy and if that's something that is important to you in your life marriage is the Covenant through which sex makes the most sense you have the most access to it and it's the safest and best thing for you and for the children that will proceed from your union she made a big deal about weight uh women are overweight women gain 20 LBS in marriage she's probably referring to the Gordon Larsson 2009 study on that but that same study showed that married men gain 30 LBS over the same period unmarried cohabiting women gain 18 pounds during that women during that period and single women gain 15 pounds during that women during that period so all that proves is as we get older instead of growing up we tend to grow out that's just life and it's nice as you get married to have someone else to grow up and out with with you and mature people recognize that and don't just reject marriage because of a biological fact of reality uh women don't want to be wives I
- [30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1805)there's no evidence Pearl gave to support that conclusion I at least I can look at anecdotally uh I can think about it in your own life how many times have you heard a girl lament that her boyfriend she'd love to get married but her boyfriend doesn't want to get married or he's dragging his feet how many times have you can't interrupt him till the time is over uh how many times have you heard a guy say oh I really wish I could get married but my girlfriend's just dragging her feet uh women are the ones women control access to be put it crudely women control access to sex and Men control access to marriage that's how it's worked traditionally and it still works today uh Pearl asked uh if marriage is such a good deal why aren't women signing up why aren't men and women signing up for it well that's like asking if exercise is good for you why don't more people go to the gym why is the gym usually empty it's because marriage is hard you have to say no to a lot of things as as a man if you choose to get married you have to say no to things your little lizard brain tells you are good like trying to hook up with
- [31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1863)as many women as possible so people may not probably don't sign up for it because they don't realize the benefits and they listen to the lower part of the brain instead of the rational part of the brain that could read studies covering hundreds of thousands of men showing that they're happier live longer and have more sustaining fulfilled lives than being unmarried so um some of the things that yeah when when Pearl brings up oh that men are divorced men are nine times more likely to commit suicide she's probably referring to the Kippo Osa 2003 study it's not that that's not men are nine times more likely to commit suicide who are divorced they're nine times more like divorced men are nine times more likely to commit suicide than divorced women but that's only because men are just more likely to complete suicide anyways than women they tend to choose more violent means to do it so but when you look at the data never married men are still just as if not more likely to commit suicide than never than divorced men so that's the comparison fallacy once again you talk about all the risks related to marriage and there are risks but there are
- [32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=1928)greater risks to being not married so that shows marriage is not a m bad deal and as I said before if marriage is such a bad deal for men if it's so bad why do 93% of men say they're willing to remarry their wives again if they had the chance why do 65% of divorced men choose and go and get remarried it's because they recognize maybe someone wasn't right for them but marriage was still right for them all right so we're going to take a quick break and then when we come back we're going to have cross-examination and PE you'll have 20 minutes to drill Trent with questions follow up whatever you want to follow up on and then Trent you'll have 20 minutes so if you're watching right now please stick around let us know how you think this debate is going in the live chat and we'll be right back I want to tell you about a course that I have created for men to overcome pornography it is called strive 21.com slat you go there right right now or if you text strive to 66866 we'll send you the link it's 100% free and it's a course I've created to help men to give them the tools to overcome pornography usually men know
## Pearl Cross-Examines Trent
- [35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2141)so we are going to go into a time of 20 minute cross- examine and I'm going to explain what it is for our viewers okay so Pearl's going to begin and in Cross examine she is free to lead the discussion however she wishes she is welcome to interrupt Trant to redirect direct Trent however she pleases uh this is her time so it's not considered rude if she does that and vice versa when when Trent does that so um let's see whenever you're ready Pearl you can begin with your 20 minutes one second and if you'd like I can let you know when you have 3 minutes left or something okay one second okay no worries take your time do you think that women should be obedient to their
- [36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2186)husbands yeah I think that I think that they should be obedient to their husbands when their husbands give them a rational request or directive but I think that husbands and wives should lead each other uh to Christ and to the goodness of their family what so what do you define as rational uh in accord with reason so something that does doesn't go against what reason would dictate can I have an example of something I'm assuming crimes of something that's rational or irrational yeah irrational yeah if a if a husband says like obviously no crimes right yeah or if a husband says you know I want you to um lose a massive amount of weight for example that would put someone's if her husband wants you to do something to change your body that would put your health at risk I would say that's irrational okay but a normal amount of weight would be fine I would say I I would say I think it's fine for husbands and wives to want each other to be healthy but it's very quickly that if a husband or a wife asks for a person to be of a certain weight that can easily be more more of out of a desire for vanity than for the other person's
- [37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2250)wellbeing what about health what about health I think it's I think it's good for husbands and wives want each other to be healthy I'm asking the husb why do you always bring it back to the husband because I'm asking about the wife I didn't ask you about the husband I'm saying I'm saying for the husband is he can he ask that his wife stays a certain weight is that rational it's rational for him to ask her to be healthy but staying at a certain weight your entire life that's not necessarily going to be healthy like saying oh I want you to always be 12 pounds like hey I got pregnant oh kind of getting past that now I don't like that that's that would be irrational that would so that would he would not be allowed to do that under your I your thought I think it would be insane if a man said that his wife needs to stay a certain why why like what's wrong with men having standards what's wrong with that Pearl you do realize that that's absolutely like literally there was a joke in the office where BJ Novak says some supermodels lose weight when they're pregnant that shows that he's just an insane chauvinistic person to demand that a stay at a certain
- [38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2308)weight even though as you get older you naturally gain weight and especially when you get pregnant you gain at least ounds of weight that would be insane to demand someone their certain weight women lose it all the time I fail to see how any of this is relevant to marriage by the way well I'm what I'm trying to understand is your mindset so so why why can't men have standards in marriage because if you're saying that men can't have standards in their own marriage like this this is this is the well you're saying it's irrational for a to demand his wife stay a certain weight why why is that wrong to stay a certain weight during their entire marriage why why is that wrong because I've seen women do it would you like me to answer the question go ahead okay because biologically we our bodies change over time they'll naturally gain and lose weight in different circumstances and your worth as a spouse whether you are a husband or a wife is not derived by your weight that's just a shallow thing now I think that both husbands and wives should encourage it's your job to be attrative I think husbands and wives should both maintain
- [39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2372)attractive but why do you always like why do you always have to bring it back CU why do you only focus on now right now because we're asking about the deal for men so I'm looking at this from the man's point of view what does the man get out of it is this a good deal he can't even ask for an inshape wife he gets a woman he can't even say question can I can I can I answer the question I'm asking ask he gets a woman who's promised to stay with him even though statistically he'll gain 30 or 40 lb and and that wom women women's job has far more of a job to be beautiful than men you know men's job is to protect and provide so do women do women what is wrong with a man asking that she stays a certain weight cuz it's cuz it's shallow it's fine to ask someone to be healthy and it's fine to encourage your spouse to maintain attractiveness not to just let yourself go but that's the same for husbands and wives neither should just let themselves go but at the same time each one should each one should be merciful knowing that time and Age come for all of us the reason that the Obesity I've looked that up before the reason that o the men are more
- [40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2441)overweight than women is because you includeed you don't look at visceral fat so like when men are a high very high like muscle percentage they're still considered overweight more so than women so a more accurate way to look at that is visceral fat and women have higher rates of visceral fat than men so actually women are more and if you look at extreme obesity women are more obese so yeah so I don't know why you're like kind of lying with that stat trying to act like men are equally obese they're not well men are men are still overweight but that still doesn't that still doesn't show none of that shows marriage is a bad deal for question should men marry women that have had abortions should men marry women that have had abortions should men marry women that have had abortions I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker should men marry women with STDs I wouldn't say here quarter of women have herpes should men marry them I'm going to answer I would like to answer your question just I would say just as it is not a disqualifier for if a man facilitated an abortion and 90% of so for every woman who chooses to get an abortion 90% of
- [41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2502)the time the man is actively or passively supporting it so just as it's not a deal breaker for a woman I'm asking for the future man I'm not saying this that he asked her to abort his this is another man's kid she's had an abortion no what I'm saying is I'm applying an equal standard here so I would say that it is not a deal breaker for a man to marry a woman who's had an abortion just like it's not a deal breaker for a woman to marry a man who had facilitated an abortion should men marry women that have slept with over 10 men should they marry someone who's slept with over 10 men I would say that when you have more sexual partners that's definitely a that's something that's concerning that could be a red flag but that but that doesn't apply I'm not going to say that someone is unmarriageable because of one particular trait what about porn okay what what what about women that have that have participated in porn should men marry women that have participated in porn I would say that that's definitely a red flag but it is not a necessarily it's not a deal breaker I can can I answer the questions pear because you can keep
- [42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2561)asking questions and I'll never answer it just would be easier if I got a yes or no because you keep giving me these roundabout and I'm just yes or no no I'm giving you good answers okay so I'd like to finish about prnography I would say it's not a deal breaker if a woman had participated in pornography uh much the same way it is not a deal breaker well it's something to be very very worried about so I'll answer it this way I it's very hard me to find anything that's a deal breaker for marriage except for maybe diagnosed uh severe mental illness for example um or addiction to drugs things like that but that would apply to men and women so when it comes to pornography I would say it's very concerning if you have if a woman had previously engaged in pornography just like it is very concerning if a woman chooses to marry a man who's previously viewed pornography but this is my question it's like why can't men have standards and and this is what I've noticed from the Trad community and like the conservatives it's like the quality of women keeps going down and down and down and we can't even definitively say hey maybe we
- [43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2620)shouldn't marry porn stars maybe we shouldn't marry overweight women you know it's like we we we constantly get rid of standards for men no I'm fine with standards as long and we can't even no no you're not because you're not even definitively saying you shouldn't marry a porn star you would never in a million years tell your son to to marry a porn star and active currently working porar PR said former even former you you would never come on someone you loved and this is this is why this is why you can keep talking or you can ask me a question because I was going to say I do believe in standards Pearl I just believe they should be applied equally so if women have a past in porn and that makes them unmarriageable fine then we should just say any man who's looked at porn don't marry him the equal the equal okay for the equal equivalent would be a man that's participated in porn that that would be the equal equivalent if if you're really going to go Apples to Apples here but what I'm asking is okay lot of who par a quarter you know a a quarter of women up to a third have an SD should men marry them should they marry them yeah just this the same
- [44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2683)reasons would apply if you ask women should they marry men who have STDs because men have lots of STDs what's and if it's okay to marry them but why is it what about the it's like the because men and women are equal men and women are equal we should treat them equally it's the craziest I don't think men and women are equal are they equal in value and digity sorry just just real quick just real quick you can ask questions in your cross-examination P I'm not I'm not coming at this from a religious point of view um what what I am saying is that you keep telling men to lower their standards because you were saying wife up these 3% of women you know 100 years ago men got a virgin they got a virgin four plus kids 3% of women are waiting till marriage nowadays you're saying wife them up anyway doesn't matter the risk who cares do you have a question Pearl so yeah my I'm going to go back to STD is not a deal breaker yes or no no they're not a if they're not a deal breaker for men they're not a deal breaker for women okay on top of that porn not a deal breaker having been involved in
- [45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2742)pornography no it's not a deal breaker but it's something to be very concerned about the same as if a man had been behind the camera doing only fans work or working at only fans but if he's truly repented then people can really change and we should give them Mercy whether they're a man or a woman people can change it doesn't mean they statistically do and women that have made those DEC decisions statistically the the grasp statistically it's not it's not a happy ending for most of them so that that's the other question why would you sign up would you ever sign a business contract that someone's paid to leave so me and you me and you are going to do business and I get a bunch of money and your children if I leave you would sign that contract if you get my children because maybe we're pairing our YouTube channels together probably not going to sell off my kids on that but it's very common in business deals Pearl where if you have a high value uh part business partner and you really want them to be a part of the Venture you might include things like a buyout clause or severance pay that's not that uncommon to amarate risks or to
- [46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2798)encourage them to take part in the project okay so would you you would you sign the contract or no when I sign a contract you've made it very I'm paid to leave where you're paid to leave if you're my business partner it depends how much and what risk if you why is it why can't you answer the question because your question is under defined and it can't be answered you've asked it in a very vague way so I can only give a vague answer and reply okay me and you sign a business deal and in that business go ahead and in that business deal I get your whole YouTube channel if I leave and I get your children are you signing it no I'm not exactly that's the point no you're not signing it and this is the thing they act like it's oneoff instances and this is what the this is what the academics tend to do they'll say here's a study funded by this organization or here's another study and they want you to not believe what's in front of your eyes men are not signing up for marriage today and you can and you can you can say it's that marriage is a great deal for men but men are naturally logical they do what makes sense a hundred years ago men were still
- [47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2857)men same software they married women in three months there's a reason it's gone up to three years I would give I would sign a contract where if you have to undergo if you're undergoing significant risk and the whole point of things that if a marriage divorces is that women undertake risks if they come and then they give up their careers they stay home and raise children for example and they majority of women are doing that the majority of women are not doing that statistically three out of four women are working so that's not the majority the point is if they go and do that and they take part in a marriage you're going to be taking you're under taking risks when you're involved in marriage well as I stated before women are twice as likely to end up in poverty after divorce than men because women are bad with women are bad with money 80% of the world's debt women have 80% of the world's debt women are not good with money and many many and many and many and many it's not true women have women have women have 80% of the world's debt and the other thing that that they don't take into account is that in this country men have more but
- [48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2919)go and women have 80% of the world's debt women are not great with money and Men earn more as well too and and the thing is you don't you're not addressing the suicide problem do you not think that's a problem of course suicide is problem it's more of a problem for men who never marry I'm asking in divorce they're nine times more likely to commit suicide after a divorce they're nine times more likely than a divorced woman you're misreading the statistic and and in Family Court when if they find within five years many men do commit what do you think you think it's just made up you think it's just fake everyone all these men all these men are saying my life my life is ruined let him answer it go no because I've actually read the studies and the problem is you're doing the comparison fallacy here you're just picking hey if you get married this bad thing can happen to you or this bad thing can happen to you and that's true but if you choose to not get married you can also have many bad things happen to you you can grow up and have no social connections you become a reck loose and you're more likely to commit suicide you're more likely just to not take care
- [49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=2980)of yourself and the statistics show that on average ever married men including divorced men live longer are healthier and rate their lives as happier than never married men it's a statistical because women because women date happy men women women pick women pick for these things what do you because I'm a woman I'm a woman I know what we pick for we like tall handsome good-look men is every married man tall handsome and good looking not every but he's usually one of those things he's usually one like he he's usually either successful or handsome or good it's women don't marry homeless men off the street there's a big difference between tall handsome and successful and homeless there's also average and so my point is women tend to pick above average men we see this on dating apps women swipe right 5% of the time the number one way people are meeting under 30 is on da because on dating apps don't know what you're talking about you're not even out dating because on dating apps Pearl the reason that women are so choosy is because there are three to four times as many men on dating apps than women so men will be constantly swiping right
- [50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3046)women can be more choosy in that environment because there's just so many more men but in real life when you look at a 1993 study another one by Taylor another one another one Taylor done in I would like to finish before Taylor and Taylor study in 2011 shows that men and women when they get married they tend to be within the same social range and attractiveness so while for dating and hookups you're correct me women on social media apps because there's so many men to pick from go for the higher quality men when it comes for marriage people tend to marry within their own social and attractiveness value bracket right but that doesn't that doesn't disprove what I'm saying what women pick a small percentage of men when given the choice that's not true because I'm talking about marriage if swim we're talking about marriage not Tinder if women but that's the number one way people are meeting under 30 and that's the thing like a lot of a lot of you guys are so out of touch you don't see like these studies take years to come out at sometime I can tell you firsthand what's going on cuz I actually
- [51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3105)talk to the people no I agree it's done to try to meet your spouse on Tinder that's right but that's what's happening that that's where the world is going and you're encouraging men to clean up women 's mess and and I say men shouldn't have to do that when shouldn't have to sign a contract where women are paid to leave I I think it's so simple if people are paid to do the wrong thing why wouldn't they do it why why would I'm not saying every woman will but every woman can what woman is going to want to say G you know what would be great don't ask questions let her go yeah well I'll go well you can answer it I answer uh uh no the women aren't saying gee it would be so awesome if I married this guy and then got full custody of the kids so now I'm a single par I have to take care of these kids good thing he sends me $440 a month to help with that that doesn't sound like a great deal to me $440 over8 years is over 100k that's lifechanging money that is life changing and this is the thing this raising children kids on 4 hundred a month and this is the thing this is the other thing that you don't think of oh this is the other thing see I'm not used I always have to write it down you you
- [52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3169)said that men don't fight for custody this is the problem with men in statistics this is the problem when people just read studies and they're not actually in the field you don't know why you don't know why men aren't fighting because a lot of times men are in the position they cannot afford to fight for custody and the lawyers will tell them not to do it because they spend 50,000 you know I I interviewed one guy uh $1.5 million in Texas $1.5 million on a divorce he still didn't get primary custody these cases are common and if you spent a day in family court if you actually were in the field you would know okay so that's that's an anecdote and it also doesn't say anything about marriage because if a man hooks up with a woman or cohabits and she gets pregnant he can have the same issues so this is not unique to marriage well yeah but marriage puts them at a higher risk because they're on the on the hook for alimony as well alimony is only paid out in 8% of marriages that's I know but what what does a man get out of marriage that he doesn't get out of a live in girlfriend what benefit well he doesn't well one benefit he's not a
- [53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3229)45-year-old Guy saying can I bring my girlfriend to the party one he's not that he's a mature stable person what what get out of it he lives longer he's no what benefit does he get out of specifically signing that contract what does he get what he women women give children outside of marriage so that he doesn't get that the women women gain weight after marriage he doesn't get that and all the stats you're saying you're attributing to marriage I would disagree I would I I would say that women I would say that women tend to marry happy successful men that is that's that is just a correlative theory that you have and that's not true because if you just look around and when you do longitudinal studies that control for Success you see that's not the case one longitudinal study found that after a man gets married and upon the birth of his first child he works 10 to 20 hours a week more than unmarried men the reason they're more women love spending men's money of course he's got to work more I mean even Car Sales even car salesman will tell you the final say is who the woman because now he's grown he's grown up Pearl he's grown up and he
- [54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3293)realizes life isn't just about him he has to take care my wife's credit card spending is off the chain and that's that's the thing I I am in more crit I am in the in the field I you that's what whatever because when you actually interview the men that have gone through this you have a completely different perspective and that's the thing because you can make we just went through covid how many studies did they have and and experts that came out and said co co you know you should take the shot oh sorry I don't want to YouTube you but you have one minute left but my my entire point is you can make a study that says anything but if you look at reality if you look at reality you look at if you look at if you look at if you look at reality you would never sign a contract that someone is paid to leave and the quality - there are just not enough wives to go around you have 
## Trent Cross-Examines Pearl
- [56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3364) all righty um we brought up something earlier about men do do you think men and women have equal Basic Value like equal dignity what do you mean by dignity they have the same intrinsic goodness men and women are equal in their Basic Value their goodness as human beings like in the I think that because it depends right it depends how like I think that men do more good in society than women and I I'm assuming that's like the Tweet you're talking about but no I'm just I'm asking because earlier I said men and women are equal and you denied that and I said I agree that men and women are unequal in many ways but surely like for example do white and black people people have equal dignity yeah sure do men and women have equal dignity sure okay good that's really good to hear uh all right um so you say marriage is a bad deal for men
- [57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3427)uh for a marriage that does so because a majority of marriages do not end in divorce uh so the for the marriages at least let's say this for the marriages that don't end in divorce are those bad deals for men if the wife gained a significant amount of weight I would say bad deal most men don't want a fat wife I would say um if the wife cheats I would say bad deal uh most men don't want a cheating wife um if the W if the wife um if they're in a sexless marriage I would say bad deal most men want I think most men if you said hey guys do you want to get married your wife isn't going to sleep with you after you have two children they would say oh hell no oh hell no what what would be what would be the best let's say a man says I would like a long-term sexual relationship with a woman okay what would you say is the best relationship relationship kind for him to what do you mean by best if a guy says to you Pearl I would like a long-term sexual relationship with a woman what kind of relationship should I pursue marriage cohabitation dating which would be the best strategy it depends on the state you're in because some some states have
- [58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3497)different different states have different laws just in general would you say I don't there's no General there's no General answer because it would depend on the state why would it because you what you're saying is that the heart let me finish I get to interrupt now and that's where it gets fun because what you you're saying is oh well it's not even though the majority of marriages don't end in divorce you still say those are a bad deal because women gain weight even though men gain weight also but you have what about the men though do do men in long-term cohabiting relationships do those women gain weight not as much but the difference is it's easier to get out of so if a woman gains weight it's much easier to break up with a girlfriend than it is a wife okay so you're able to have higher standards how much how much weight can a woman gain in marriage before you consider her unmarriageable depends on the guy um I I think it's unfair more than like 20 pounds 15 PBS mhm yeah what are you doing ladies get on the treadmill wow okay yeah you know I think it's okay and I think it's good for women I think it is
- [59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3564)good to Gordan Larson study cohabiting women gain uh what was it they gain those those Co yeah less but I've seen around 10 I've seen 10 that's the study you're citing for 24 pounds gain they gain 18 pounds in marriage people the problem is if you're saying that it's a bad deal for men to be in a relationship where women gain weight and if women gain weight in all relationships aren't you really just saying women are a bad deal for men not marriage no no I'm I'm saying that women the difference is in long-term relationship you can say you need to change or or I'm going to go and women tend to act better when men have standards okay do you dis do you agree that married men rate themselves uh sorry do married men live longer than unmarried men yeah probably okay so that's because I think women tend to pick healthier men okay I mean I'm I'm a woman we we want you know I mean why do you think women are throwing themselves at these like NBA player we want the we want the good jeans are most men who get married not NBA players no but you can see when you look at the men that women are throwing themselves at you can see what women
- [01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3635)select for okay so but you would agree though that even if that is correct even if it's correct that women choose men who are happier and healthier if a man chooses to get married then that would seem that he has is or has made himself to be a happy healthy individual yeah if he if he if he if he get successfully marries can you say the question man successfully marries a woman does that mean he has become a happy and healthy individual not because of the marriage but he he she was probably selected because he was that type of person so he's made himself into that kind of a person he's disciplined himself he's you know made himself at least somewhat successful happy and healthy okay good so he be comes that I wouldn't attribute it to marriage though I would attribute it to them like I think men are going to do what they're going to do they're on on a Miss on average though does marriage take that away from men their happiness and their health I would say yes I would say there are more men in unhappy marriages than happy out of the original hundred that got married so so if you take if you
- [01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3709)take if you take the I'm answering the question you want that's fine so you know the the the study you're talking about 3 5% I I've heard that's a bit dishonest um I I've heard it's more 50% 45 45% of marriages end in divorce um the last the last one was from 2023 I know it's a little off because of Co but um I think if you include sexless marriages women that belittle their husband that's really common uh women that U make fun of their husbands in public you're taking it away from my main point so you're claiming that these healthy men who get married the majority of them they lose their happiness do you have a study that shows that because I let me finish I have cited the General Social Survey Gallup surveys hundreds of thousands of people who are tracked Harvard adult study 80 years that married men rate themselves as happier and healthier the majority of them attributing that but you're attributing that to marriage I'm not I'm just say what I'm saying is that even if marriage is negative in some ways it doesn't take that away from them you're making the claim that the majority of married men aren't happy but you have no study to
- [01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3781)back that up I'm saying that you you can back it up when you look at 40% let's say 40% of marriages end in divorce okay 40% now you have six left a quarter of them are sexist boom that's over 50 that's not that's not true a quarter women women on average and then on average so at least half of the women gain 25 I'm ask you another question I'm going ask you another question again so we do surveys and we ask people if they're happy and I've cited multiple studies okay where hundreds of thousands of married men are let me are asked if they are happy and the majority 80% to 90% say yes can you cite a study that shows that the majority of men in marriage say they're not happy well you're saying in marriage I'm including divorced sure no but my original statement my original statement was my and I'm going to interrupt because it's my turn my original question was for marriage since the majority of marriages don't end in divorce and if divorce is the only bad thing then marriage is a good deal so then setting that aside you cannot show that married men are unhappy no data for that but but I also added in I said If a
- [01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3850)woman gains weight that's a bad deal if a woman cheats that's a bad de do do the men say it's not worth but do the men say it's not worth it to them and they you asked you asked what I would classify as a successful marriage are you you that was that you I made the premise the debate is not whether thinks marriage is a b deal good deal you said I could make the premise so I said a good deal is classified as a woman that stays in shape FS her husband and stays married and is obedient so if she's not screw if she's not having sex with her husband and she's gaining weight who should DET that's that's that's 60% at least half of them are doing that who should we look to to determine the standard of whether marriage is a good let me finish whether marriage is a good deal married men or Pearl Davis I think you should look at men and what they're choosing and they're not choosing marriage because if it was a good deal it would be an easy sale good products get sold get good products is exercise a good deal or gyms a good is exercising a good deal exercising is a good deal but I would most people sign would I wouldn't say those are the same thing
- [01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3913)because again if women were benefiting men like they were a hundred years ago if we look at 100 years ago men signed up for marriage within three months that's all it took all right here's my next here's my next question if marriage is so bad including people who end in divorce I didn't say all marriage is bad okay if if in general Mar I said out of 151 if it's Mo if it's more likely if it's greater than not that marriage it will be bad and if that's the case why do 65% of divorced men get married again even though they've already been through a marriage that's failed if it's so bad Pearl why do the majority of men get married again well I would say you know people don't always make logical decisions when it comes to love but but my question would go back to why aren't men signing up in general okay so no so so you're just so anybody who just disagrees with your standard of marriage they're just being illogical no okay I again I I said a good deal I clarified it in the beginning I said good deal doesn't gain weight sleeps with her husband stays married I think that's the bare minimum
- [01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=3985)M all why why can't this be the a good deal for marriage if a married man says that he's happy because I don't think that happy I think one happiness studies like how do they how do they measure it they you literally ask the person if they're happy yeah people lie okay so it's just a giant conspiracy it's not a conspiracy okay so are do you think most men who are married are unhappy I think most men that sign up for marriage out of the original not stay married that sign up for married marriage mhm 51 are unhappy with that original deal and we can agree at least 40% divorce right yeah there's a there's a 40% what per of men rate themselves as Happy you don't get you don't you don't get to ask that the questions I get to ask them and as I said before just because a marriage ends in divorce it doesn't mean that person now thinks that marriage is a bad deal since the majority of men who get divorced choose to go back and get married anyways want to go back to some of the different why don't why don't the majority of ask you don't get to ask I'm going to go back
- [01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4050)here cuz if it was such a good deal they'd sign up yeah well they would good products get sold you know you think Elon Musk is running out of his cars okay when they first came out anyways I don't know about now but all right I heard that truck was bad all right let's see here cuz you you've brought up 80% women get HPV that's crazy okay what percent of men get HPV similar but they're only the sexually active ones and there was a higher percent of sexually active women let me I guess I'll start asking these questions do do do men have a lot of STDs a smaller not at the they're at a lower rate than women how do you know that you can Google it CDC okay but still do the majority of men have STDs who are unmarried sexually active well if they're sexually active but the minority this is the thing you guys don't know what's going on cuz you guys have been out of the game so long the number one way that people are meeting his dating apps women swipe right 5 10 up to 20% of the time what does that mean okay more a minority of men can even sleep around so when you guys are saying men men stop sleeping around a
- [01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4126)minority of men even get the choice to do that do men cheat yeah okay so if a man cheats and he leaves his wife to be with another woman is it fair that he should have to compensate her by paying for things like child support now that he's abandoned her is he going to be an active father if a man it's one thing so I'm ask the question again if a man clar if a man is married to a woman they have three kids and he says wow I'd like to be married to this other lady instead that I had an affair with and he abandons his wife and children and his wife has been raising these kids and now they're on their own isn't it just that he should compensate them for putting them in that position by pay how many kids how old let's say three kids 3 six and N 3 six and n and it he completely abandoned them not even he tells the the wife you can have full custody the kids I want to go and get remarried shouldn't he have to support them since he was an awful person and abandoned them and put them in this position you know what sorry no I don't believe in child support I don't believe in alimony I think it's equal women have
- [01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4194)fought we have fought for equality wait we have fought for equality we got it so now you get a job like everyone else it's a sad situation but overwhelmingly men aren't the ones doing that women there are far more deadbeat moms than deadbeat dads do you think you s for men no so you don't call it sing for men and saying that a that if a woman does something bad she should have to pay consequences for it but if a man no I'm going to finish if a man abandons his family cuz he wants to screw some other lady and puts them into poverty you're saying he shouldn't have to spend a dime on that why equality baby because women abandon their families all the time and they're not punished they're rewarded so I say equal rights equal lefts you guys fought for equality here it is then isn't the answer shouldn't the answer be both that instead of saying both men and women should be allowed to be awful people shouldn't we say men and women should both be held to higher standards I would say I I it depends what you mean by higher standards but what I would say is I don't think we should have child support I don't think we should have alimony I I think it's wrong I I even
- [01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4264)even if a man aband he he just leaves his wife has been a stay-at-home mom for 10 years three kids she has been out of the workplace going to have a difficult time finding a job and and I know personally women that this has happened to and he leaves and goes have sex with someone else we're not talking about other women being bad you're saying in that case the man shouldn't be comp to provide for the family he aband well I would say for the same case that if women cheat and leave for another husband they shouldn't have alimony or child support either I'm saying in both cases we should not we should not have alimon ask question say I don't I don't believe in paying people to make wrong decisions I don't believe in that all right so if a woman let's say you have a stay-at-home dad successful woman has been out she's boss be a lawyer sure she's she's she's the boss girl lawyer turns into the in She-Hulk when she needs to whatever and she's Mak a lot of money and then she leaves her husband and kid says hey Frank you can have the kids I'm going to run off with this other lawyer at the office and now he and the kids are in
- [01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4326)poverty do you think that she should have to pay child support to them nope I think he should get a job okay and so should she so you don't believe do you yeah do you believe in marriage at all I believe what kind of marriage that that's the I I don't believe in marriage as it is today if we if we tomorrow if we tomorrow got rid of Child Support got rid of alimony got rid of all these incentives for bad decisions fine then then I would have no problem but my issue is one the quality of women is lower than ever before the risk is the risk is higher and women are paid to leave what is What is marriage one person for a lifetime and the woman submits to her husband is an obedient for a lifetime okay but I am not um well and see I guess my head goes in a couple directions because the other thing is today it's nothing today the you know you said the average marriage is longer than 7 years let's say it's 12 years the med is 21 years the average let's let's say 21 that's still not a lifetime in a quarter of a quarter of divorces are gray divorces so it happens when when people are in their 50s and 60s so so that's the other thing about these stats
- [01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4398)it doesn't predict who in the future gets divorced it says today so the and it doesn't include people that are separate I know couples in their 50s and 60s they've been separated for years they're still counted as married so um my my my issue again is marriage as it is today and I just think you would never sign a contract that pays somebody to leave I think it's super logical if someone's paid to do the wrong thing they're going to do it and what are women doing they're leaving so shocked if marriage is a lifelong Union and let's say a mar a woman does what you say she should do right let's say I don't say women should do well do you say women should be obedient to their husbands right if if the woman gets married but some get married should she stay home and raise the kids pearl is she well it it depends and I can't give you a straight answer like I can't I can't give you a straight answer it depends what does he want let's say he wants her to stay home and raised kids fine then yeah sure and you think that that's a reasonable thing so the majority of women aren not the majority and that's that's that's the thing that
- [01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4461)let me finish so if a woman does that then she takes a significant amount of risk right you know she makes herself she does she take risk in choosing to become financially dependent on one person yes she does but women aren't choosing that that's a funny thing women are having one to two children they're in public school so let's not act like these women are home house wiing it up these kids are in public school for eight hours a day you're right men are men and women they aren't choosing marriage both of them aren't true but didn't you say men are in control of marriage that's what you said earlier yeah so really it's more they're not choosing to do it right exactly and women aren't choosing because women are not wives today okay uh I'm man up and marry these you got one minute left okay do you think do you think that men are marriageable who've looked at pornography yeah how about men who have helped like run the camera at only fans what percent of do that try no I'm asking you the question this is like come on I'm asking you a question who
- [01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4528)have run the camera personally not I not for me like run the camera at only fans all right we only have a few seconds left so I'm just going to take it back to the main thing the final main question okay okay do just a yes or no do the majority 80% of men who are married say they are happy yes or no they say it but we don't know if they're telling the Truth 
## Q&A
- All right we are going to go into a time of Q&amp;A in which we'll take questions from our local supporters and from Super Chatters what do y'all think um since we have so many questions would uh 2 minutes each be a good idea just so and it can be less than that but it might be a good idea just to keep it to that all right okay so here's here's my first question um and I'll ask you first Pearl and then Trent and you can take up to 2 minutes doesn't have to be long do your best job summarizing his position in a way that sounds convincing like I want to see that you've understood his position and then I'm going to give you a chance to articulate her position to see if you've understood hers go first Trent believes that men should just man up and marry these
- [01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4668)Catholic Viking from over on locals and Thursday you want to throw up some super Chats on the screen here I love when he calls me boss man I feel so important Catholic Viking uh so we'll start with Trent Trent is there a point in debating marriage outside the Catholic Sacrament and if so how do you accomplish that when it can mean whatever that person defines it as feels like what is a woman type of question and we need to define marriage as the sacrament you go first and then you'll have two minutes as well good yeah so marriage is something that God gave the human race uh it was created with Adam and Eve our first parents so marriage is not a uniquely Catholic thing that's why when the government tries to change marriage to make so-called same-sex marriage that's wrong because the government can't change what marriage is anymore than it can change what friendship or Justice is marriage is a natural institution nearly every society on Earth has discovered it for the good of men and women and the children that proceed from their unions so marriage is a natural institution the Catholic Church recognizes that if someone in
- [01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4731)Pacific Islands or in another country if they enter into a monop ideally lifelong sexually exclusive Union then we call that marriage and we recognize it and it's better for societies that have marriage because this is better for the children that proceed from those unions than it is for anything else all right um can you repeat the question I could if I wasn't desperately looking up at the questions while I asked that and have thereby forgotten no it's not your fault uh he's so this person's asking um whether there's any point to even debating marriage outside of the sacrament um because yeah people defy marriage however they want to so if we're going to be debating marriage shouldn't we figure out that we both agree on what it is before we debate it he's like how do you accomplish it when it can mean whatever person def that's yeah no I think that's a problem I come to because people look at it from a religious point of view and I'm coming from a legal point of view so I would also add just as a non-catholic and a non-Christian can know what a woman is from reason alone they can know what
- [01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4792)marriage is from reason alone all right ask po this question why wait but then why do they keep saying gay marriage like that's legal now because people often don't act reasonably they they it's unreasonable okay okay this question is from Tony he says Pearl do you see a difference between a woman who has no regret for current digressions versus one who has repented that is uh from current porn and unrepentant versus repentant and regretful so in other words is there a difference between a woman who's screwed up in the past and doesn't regret doesn't repent of it and there are people who have screwed up in the past we've all made mistakes when when it comes for qu if I phrase the question as if my brother was to like date like if I was recommending my brother date someone I I don't think it would matter I I think that if you really want what's best for a guy you want him to have high standards for his wife Trent you want to respond to that yeah I think that people should choose to marry uh the be you know the best person for them and choose to marry someone who has a good chance of being in a lifelong Union but not all
- [01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4858)of us you know people make mistakes in their lives uh but when it so for example men large large majorities of men look at pornography and have sex outside of marriage that harms their future chances in marriage but not irreparably a much tinier percentage of women uh do things like Beyond only fans uh and that also harms their chances in a future marriage but not irreparably I get a question because it seems like and this is to you and I'll get um Pearl seem to be saying like you just have of touch like you're old like you don't understand what it's like today so maybe that was true for you back in the late ' 90s or the early 2000s that women were marriageable they were better but isn't it possible that you are out of touch and that she's right just today I mean why don't you ask young men and have you asked young men maybe they would agree with P sure and when you look when you look at studies and you look at young men who have gotten married and who stay married they do say that me that women are marriageable what Pearl is doing here is that if you create uh so high of a standard that no woman can meet You' just
- [01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4916)created you created you've created an arbitrary standard and it's also sexist if you don't apply the same standards to men such as don't marry a man who is actively or passively supported an abortion which is going to be the same percentage as women involved in abortions I'm saying to treat men and women equally in this regard and we do see that there's if if what Pearl's doing is the reverse of a radical feminist who says oh men are terrible men are awful look at all these awful terrible things that men do and say there's no good men out there that's not true it's plenty of good men out there you just have an anti-male standard to exclude them and that's the same for people who try to do the same to say that marriage is bad because of women I don't think it's crazy for men to ask for an inshape woman that didn't have an abortion STD or debt I don't think that's crazy yeah that doesn't I don't no tattoos I don't think that's crazy and I would say that to make to make it a deal breaker that you're going to pick any mistake a person makes much that what you're doing is the same as a woman who says it's not crazy for me to
- [01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=4975)say I want to marry a man who makes six figures and has a six-pack that not say those are the same because you're are the same for well can a woman say she wants a guy who is in shape and has a good job fine okay so then we have problem yeah and then I would say that a man so can a man be in shape if he's 15 pounds overweight I would say in shape is the BMI scale so most for the most part and visceral fat that's what you got to look at okay do do you think most middle-aged guys are you know are musly or they got a little fat I think again we're going back to what do men get out of marriage I don't think it's crazy for men to say I don't want a woman that's had an STD an abortion or debt but real think you think it's crazy either right so and and by that logic by that logic there would not be enough wives to go around I would say the Next Generation it's unreasonable because if you appli the same standard and say for women it's reasonable for women to not want a man who has an STD or has looked at pornography or has been involved in abortion procedures then there wouldn't be any men later both men and women
- [01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5044)aren't in great shape today you're trying to make it sound like it's all women's fault what I'm saying it's just people's fault and we need each other can I ask you a question now Trent I thought brought up a good point earlier when he said sure okay I'm willing to accept that women are in way worse state today than they may have been 50 years ago but that's Alo true of dudes and so couldn't it just be the case that both men and women in some ects maybe much worse than they were 50 years ago I would say that men are more marriageable than women today I I would say that most men have jobs and most men are not sleeping around like that I I wouldn't say that porn is as detrimental to a marriage as you're saying if a man looks at violent pornography does that is women look at violent pornography more than men no I'm asking the question do you think women like look at 50 Shades of Gray all that stuff that's the other thing women look at pornography at a much higher rate than people really are willing to is it higher than men I wouldn't say higher than men but violent pornography women look at more on positive do do do you don't think men
- [01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5101)look at violent pornography more not as much as women not not have study to back that up not not off the top no no not off the top of my head you can look it up though just so this doesn't go off the rail I was going to you can look at 50 Shades of Gray that was like one of the biggest grossing movies all right so this questions for you uh elazar Palmer thank you so much for the Super Chat says I work with young adults daily at Catholic University Pearl can you give one argument that is not anecdotal or subjective as to why marriage is not the move for young people I would say because not young for women it's beneficial for women sure but for men because women are paid to leave simple you want to respond well I don't understand wasn't the question about men whether why men should not get married can you scroll back up well no it says why you says young people you just stay on until the end people so I said for women it's it's yeah okay but so here's a this this question is also for Trent Trent why aren't young people getting married uh why that's a sociological
- [01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5165)question so there's a lot of different elements to it one why aren't they getting married the marriage rate has been decreasing one reason I would say is because people fill their heads with anti-marriage propaganda like if you tell people over and over again half of all marriages fail half of all marriages fail when that's not true the majority of marriages last a lifetime they think that they're not going to make it uh so they've they've emed a cultural attitude that's anti-marriage also frankly so there's a lot of men back in the day uh well put it crudely uh no one buys the cow if you can get the milk for free so I mean for men most of the time if they wanted to have a sexual encounter with a woman uh they married a woman or they paid for a prostitute now through the rise of online pornography other elements like that you have a lot of men who had a failure to launch they're not getting jobs they're not getting discipline they're looking at porn every day including violent porn and so they're not becoming the men women need them to be for marriage we also have difficult economic issues right now people are
- [01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5225)delaying marriage to get more advanced degrees though I will say that if you're college educated uh you have one of the lowest risks of divorce one thing I think I might be sympathetic to what Pearl is saying is it's it seems like many men especially in the conservative kind of Christian Movement we're very comfortable criticizing men you know your failure to lawn want you're a slob get yourself in shape but we seem less likely well and and can you scroll down just to touch he's saying back this way you're inot S I also ask you and men and women so I would say that women for example men and women both think there's many things I want to pursue in my 20s and 30s before I get married down and I would encourage both of them that is not a good strategy a good a better strategy is to get vocational technical or college education get stable employment and get married probably around in your mid 20s are you willing to criticize women today women a lot of women are a lot of women are overly picky uh so they'll just as what uh Pearl is saying you know men should have standards they have standards women have extremely high standards saying that men have to get an
- [01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5289)exorbitantly high income uh they look at a relationship like oh he needs to have this certain height or he needs to have so just as what Pearl was saying I would say that just as unreasonable for Pearl to say married men have to demand a woman not gain 15 pounds in their marriage it's unreasonable for women to say I'm not going to marry a guy unless he's 6 tall unless he makes six figures unless th rather what we should look for is is the person virtuous is the person someone uh is it being fat gluttony is it being fat gluttony isn't that gluttony no people can be fat without being gluttonous and they can be gluttonous without being fat they're not the same thing you want to scroll to another question Thursday he does all right okay this person let's see shaa rencher thank you so much research show marriage matters to kids with more resources and improved outcomes for kids healthy kids become healthy adults if you want suitable adults shouldn't you make them in the environment proven to do that marriage do you want to go I I don't disagree with that if the laws aren't paying women to leave and and
- [01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5350)that's the problem you're going to get the same outcomes we got last generation and the generation before that with every round of people that gets married and it's just going to be less and less so you will not have that outcome until you switch the laws if the laws were changed how you would like them to be changed do you think marriage would them be a better deal for men yeah that's my whole point and so what should be changed to make that should be no no alimony no child support 50/50 custody off the bat all right so if that was changed tomorrow all of a sudden would you be okay yeah go get men fine what do you think about that if that's a main point yeah it's just it's just the loss today it's crazy it's people have no like people have no idea how disadvantaged men are in the court system so if that was changed today yeah fine what I would say say is we can always improve things like child custody cases Family Court just because something can always be improved it doesn't follow that it's so bad we should have nothing to do with it now higher education can certainly be improved but people who get college
- [01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5408)degrees tend to be better off than people who don't so it's still a smart move for people to go and get one so just because something can be improved doesn't mean it's so bad you shouldn't take part in it now so for men if you want to have a sexual relationship with a woman uh which children can come from you're much better off being married than being unmarried because you still have all of these custody issues but you come from the weaker position of being unmarried and if you say well I'm just going to stay away from women entirely you risk growing up to be a never married man because women are the ones who create most of the social connections for men most of my friends are because my wife gets me my friends that's how wives work a lot of the time but if you're a never married man you risk growing to be old reclusive unhealthy and more at risk of Sude but what if but but again the women don't want to get married that we've I just I just gave you I just gave you I yeah yeah if they pulled this is um The Book of Numbers so they pulled Millennial women and GenZ women wait wait wait wait listen listen
- [01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5464)wait wait wait so so I'm saying they pulled women on this and and they did not rate men as high in their priority list and if we just look even outside of that you look in the real world women have the most choice to get married at 22 we're not picking it all right we got a question here from Nathaniel who's a local supporter he I'm laughing cuz I've got a gigantic green bottle and I how ridiculous that looks but he says for Pearl how do you consider yourself Catholic when you go against the church's teaching on the sanctity of marriage and the wrongness of adultery bad do you consider yourself Catholic yeah I'm Catholic do you accept all the things Catholic sorry I'll let you do you think adultery is sinful yeah okay good I just I don't think that men I think it is a bad deal if you are signing a contract that the other party is paid to leave that's my opinion right so it's your opinion isn't that marriage is bad your opinion is that given deal the current law and the quality of the women are so low that it is a bad deal for I would say that what do what is a better deal having some extra money
- [01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB7OuwPh3rw&t=5524)and being alone and miserable when you're old years or possibly having less money but a greater chance of having a family children and a fulfilling life well I I wouldn't say those are the two choices because option C again is men committing suicide that that is or men being financially wrecked at 45 getting to see I mean finish like think about that the it's normal for men to see their kids every other weekend that's normal men aren't picking this they they just they look at the the field they look at they look at the field and they say this is too expensive and too hard of a fight does does that happen for the majority of marriages that happens to a significant enough that that happens to a significant enough amount of marriages that it I would say it's too risky if I had let's say I had a two out of a hundred chance of being financially ruined and had my kids stolen from me I wouldn't do it okay I I think that's so what's the option as a faithful Catholic if you if you think it's a bad deal for men to get married today is it okay for a man to fornicate well um by that I mean sex
