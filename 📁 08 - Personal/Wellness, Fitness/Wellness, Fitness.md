#### Caffeine Consumption
- Delay caffeine by 90 minutes to 2 hours

## How Many Meals a Day and When?
- Strategy
	- If we can't resist eating, then we should get used to eating the most in the afternoon and eating while still keeping it healthy (not desserts every night or pigging out)
	- Eat first meal 6 - 8 hours after waking up
	- Fast 12 - 16 hours (might be a lot to start)
- Myths
	- "8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death" - [not true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspirekMLqg&t=40s)
		- Essentially the study concluded that people eating most of their calories in the evening correlated with cardio death.  Could have been people eating unhealthily or really anything. The author even stated this.
## Stimulants

- Why ADHD meds?
	- Hard to focus in environment
	- HARD to focus on tasks that I'm not interested in
	- Transition time to focus and sustainability is undesirable
	- Noticeably low function of neuroplasticity
	- The goal
		- Adjust dosage, timing, and long-term plan
		- Increase neuroplasticity
		- Increase focus
- The strategy
