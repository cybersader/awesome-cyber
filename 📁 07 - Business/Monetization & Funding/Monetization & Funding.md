# Open Source Projects
The goal is to have the ability to show costs for the solution to the users and have them conditionally make up for the costs via one time payments, subscription models, etc.  I've always wondered why there isn't a solution that can transparently and dynamically take the needs of the organization, communicate them to the user, and give them the ability to pay in the ways that they want to.  Lastly, such a solution also needs to operate in a way that doesn't incur costs for the organization facilitating such a system.
