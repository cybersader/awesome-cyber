# Truenas.local Stopped Working
- My truenas.local domain stopped working all of the sudden, so I'm troubleshooting the issue
- The local IP address still works fine
- To fix this, I got rid of the IPv6 address and it started working for seemingly no reason

More troubleshooting to get to SMB shares - [Cannot Connect to Truenas SMB](../Cannot%20Connect%20to%20Truenas%20SMB/Cannot%20Connect%20to%20Truenas%20SMB.md)
