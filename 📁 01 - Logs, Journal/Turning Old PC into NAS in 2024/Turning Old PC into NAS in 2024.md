They are optimized for 24/7 operation in multi-bay systems, support NASware technology for improved reliability and system performance, and are available in capacities up to 18TB.
2. **Seagate IronWolf**: Another popular choice for NAS setups, Seagate IronWolf drives are built for always-on, always-accessible 24Ã—7 performance. They offer AgileArray technology for optimal reliability and system agility, and are available in capacities up to 18TB. IronWolf Pro models offer higher performance and are designed for commercial and enterprise NAS systems.
3. **Synology HAT5300**: If you are using a Synology NAS, their HAT5300 series drives are optimized for Synology devices, offering high performance and reliability. These drives are engineered to handle high workloads and data-intense environments, making them suitable for business and professional use.
4. **Toshiba N300**: Designed for personal, home office, and small business NAS systems, the N300 series offers high reliability and performance with up to 18TB of capacity. These drives are built to handle high data workloads in a multi-RAID NAS environment.

When selecting a drive, consider the following factors:
- **Capacity**: Ensure the drive meets your storage needs both now and in the foreseeable future.
- **Reliability**: Look for drives designed for 24/7 operation with features like vibration protection and built for NAS systems.
- **Warranty and Support**: Longer warranties and good customer support can be invaluable, especially in a NAS setup where data availability is crucial.
- **Price**: While important, the cheapest option may not always offer the best value in terms of reliability and longevity.

Always check for compatibility with your specific NAS model and consider buying drives from multiple batches to avoid the risk of simultaneous failures from the same production batch.

### SSD Not Showing up in Destination List for Installing as TrueNAS Boot Drive - OS Not Seeing SSD
- TLDR ðŸ˜† - [LawrenceTechTips answer/solution to my question - YouTube clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxoJhZaSWuA89uWk8NBZqkMjexvh31yF5N?si=g0mqJ534weA0tIe6)

- Still not detecting in TrueNAS installer, but is detecting in BIOS
	- [Truenas Scale not seeing SSD to install on | TrueNAS Community](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truenas-scale-not-seeing-ssd-to-install-on.104153/)
		- Please ignore my previous post. I have fixed the problem.  
		- I reformatted the boot disc to ExFAT, put it back in the NAS system and the installation USB recognised it.
	- I would put it onto my other computer, but it doesn't support Gen 3 PCIE....yayyyyy ðŸ˜‘
	- There's one option only.  USB/live boot Linux onto the machine and reformat everything with GParted.  I swear I run into every issue under the sun with these projects ðŸ˜†.
		- Since Kali Linux has GParted, I'll just boot with that
		- [Get Kali | Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-live) 
			- [gparted | Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/gparted/)
	- Used balenaEtcher to flash to a USB, plugged it in, and got a GNU Grub screen.  I'm pretty sure the CPU supports graphics, so not sure what the issue is
	- Trying to flash Kali to USB with Rufus instead
		- [Rufus - Create bootable USB drives the easy way](https://rufus.ie/en/)
	- Nm I used a Medicat USB I had lying around
	- Couldn't see the drive
	- Tried another SSD with old Windows.  It booted.  However, again, TrueNAS doesn't detect this SSD.
	- Motherboard (mobo) issue? Like seriously?
- SSD not showing up in OS, but showing up in BIOS (basic input output)
	- Here's my thinking.  It's likely a BIOS setting or the drive is in some format that doesn't work with TrueNAS scale installation or being detected by the OS
		- ![](_attachments/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/IMG-20240324174733667.png)
	- SSD and storage formatting explained
		- [Filesystems and Partition Schemes](Filesystems%20and%20Partition%20Schemes/Filesystems%20and%20Partition%20Schemes.md) 
			- `Partition schemes are crucial for an OS to recognize, access, and manage the partitions within a storage device.`
		- ![](_attachments/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/IMG-20240324174733710.png)
	- RAID and AHCI
		- **BIOS/UEFI Settings and SSD Detection**: If your BIOS is set to RAID mode but you're not using a RAID configuration, your OS might not recognize the SSD unless the correct RAID drivers are installed. Conversely, `setting it to AHCI mode typically allows for immediate recognition and utilization of the SSD by the OS, assuming the OS supports AHCI (which most modern operating systems do).`
		- **MBR and Bootability**: Whether an SSD is formatted as MBR or GPT is more about the disk's partitioning scheme and doesn't directly impact how the BIOS/UEFI detects the SSD in terms of AHCI vs. RAID mode. However, `GPT is required for booting from disks larger than 2TB and for systems that use UEFI instead of traditional BIOS.`
	- Changing settings in BIOS to make it show up:
		- Enable AHCI instead of RAID
			- This fixes things because GPT is required for UEFI-based boots instead of BIOS
			- ![](_attachments/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/IMG-20240324174733761.png)

			- ![](_attachments/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/IMG-20240324174733799.png)
	- Boot to another USB like Medicat USB or a Linux distro then apt install or get "gparted", so we can change the partition from basic/classic MBR to GPT ........ *phew* that's a lot of stuff to get this silly SSD working

	- `When powering on a TrueNAS system, the system attempts to connect to a DHCP server from all live interfaces to access the web UI. On networks that support Multicast Domain Name Services (mDNS), the system can use a host name and domain to access the TrueNAS web interface. By default, TrueNAS uses the host name and domainÂ **truenas.local**. To change the host name and domain in the web interface, go toÂ **Network**Â and clickÂ **Settings**Â on theÂ **Global Configuration**Â widget.`
		- I don't think mDNS is an options for my current router, so I might have to reconfigure the router to make this work.

## Setting Up Storage
[Setting Up Storage |](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/configure/setupstoragescale/) - TrueNAS docs
### My Storage Strategy
- For now
	- Start out with one 12 TB HDD in "Stripe" storage mode
		- `While a single-disk pool is technically allowed, it is not recommended.`
		- This is not ideal, but I don't have money to throw around right now
	- Back storage up to cloud via S3, Backblaze, etc
	- Back up boot drive somehow
- Later
	- Add another drive for RAID and redundancy using mirror layout
- (AND/OR) Later
	- Have 3 total drives using RaidZ1 layout
### TrueNAS UI Storage Pool Configuration
- Plugging in my HDD
	- Plugged in the SATA connectors while the computer is on
