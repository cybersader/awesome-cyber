# Questions and answers
1. I’d like to start of this discussion by getting to know you personally, can you tell me a little about yourself and your journey to getting where you are in your career today?
    1. I grew up in the age of the social media boom. For kids my age at the time that happened around 2007 and on. The thing about the internet is that when you build something so vast it always comes with its curses. I noticed this even as a kid and I thought that someone has to do something about it. With privacy it's all about staying private so that information about you can't be exploited against you. With cybersecurity it's a little bit different. It's a lot more technical or complicated. A hacker for instance is someone who is exploiting IT systems for their own gain. However that exploitation is against the interests of the company that actually owns those systems. So the whole point of cybersecurity is to account for the unconsented exploitation or misuse of someone's IT systems for conflicting interests.
    2. How I got to my career today. The how would have been networking. The motivation is that I like it.
2. What is your educational background? Is this a field only available to those with a specific degree?
    1. My educational background would fall under computer science as that's my bachelor's degree. I also have a master's degree in cybersecurity and trusted systems. There is a lot of discussion and friction around what defines talent in the cyber security industry and really IT as a whole.
    2. Cyber security doesn't require a degree in cybersecurity and surely not even in a broader topic like computer science. Cyber security is the idea of accounting for conflicting interests and exploitation of IT systems, resources, and really any company resource through an IT medium.
    3. Skills and talent needed to do so varies widely based on the business vertical, specific problems the business is trying to solve, and these systems and technology that that business uses.
3. What were some of the key factors in wanting to join this field of study?
    1. It allows for a lot of flexibility on where you want to go. Everything needs cybersecurity so you can really just find the intersection between defending against people who want to exploit companies for their own interests and some topics that you're interested in. For instance you might have someone who really likes the idea of physical security and locks but doesn't know how that coincides with cybersecurity in the software sense. Turns out this is an area you can get into with the software that these physical security systems implement.
    2. If you have a background in manufacturing, then you could become a consultant for OT and ICS security.
    3. There are some general skills in cybersecurity such as threat modeling and thinking about the risk and organization has with its IT systems that apply everywhere. So cybersecurity does have skills unique to cyber but you can really go anywhere with those skills.
    4. The large scale conflicts that we have today often revolve now around cyber warfare and cybersecurity. I wanted to have an impact in an area that's new and growing and dynamic.
    5. Also I come from an engineering mindset and I'm not so great at remembering things so this appealed to me way more than the current state of the medical field.
    6. I felt that my talents and perspective could bring a lot of value to the table for solutions.
4. How long have you been in the field/how long are you planning to stay in the field?
    1. I've been in this field of study for about 5 years but in a professional setting for 3.
    2. I plan to stay in this field as long as I can and maybe transition into a teaching setting or providing a solution as a business.
5. What are some of the day-to-day tasks that you’re expected to complete?
    1. The day-to-day tasks are different from company to company. In a smaller company you will sometimes be working to simplify an automate things because your team is so small and such a large organization.
    2. Sometimes the cyber security team doesn't do any of the Frontline work but is more of a consultant or advisor to those frontline teams. For example you may have operations, infrastructure, development, and analyst teams that do all of the front line work that directly affects the business. Then the security operations team takes on some of the monitoring tasks - usually things like log management, network security, and making sure teams are following compliance and regulation initiatives.
    3. One day to day task that will always be applicable though is staying on top of the news or more specifically threat intelligence related to your organization.
    4. This could be as simple as checking an RSS feed or an email your subscribe to for vulnerabilities or current attack campaigns related to your organization's technology or risk surface.
    5. As much as businesses like to be proactive, a lot of cybersecurity programs in an organization are more so reactive and have the goal of the lessening the blow to the organization when an incident does occur.
6. What do you find to be a good workflow or routine for your day to day?
	1. Check the news and threat feeds
	2. Check company wiki and chat for any activity
	3. day-to-day changes all the time
7. What are some of the tools and programs that you use to convey data in a way for others to interpret easily?
    1. CSV files with Excel or Python, markdown formatted plain text, diagram drawing tools like excali draw, and others.
    2. Query languages and regex
    3. Database technologies like postgres
    4. Sharex screenshot tool
    5. OBS and lossless cut
8. What are some of the most important factors that go into your work?
    1. Is there buyin from leadership and other teams
    2. Risk factors and cost benefit of the solution
    3. How much time do we have
9. What are expectations that one could expect from a successful analyst? 1.
10. What are some practices that help you to get better at coding?
    1. The number one thing that I could say is to work with another coder
    2. However, also, work on projects that you're actually interested in. 
    3. When you need to code something at work, take your time to figure out if there's a library already designed for it. This usually means looking up terminology or asking some large language model if it's ever heard of solutions related to that problem. A lot of the times a masterfully designed library is only hard to find because it uses specific terminology - merely because it relates to a niche problem.
    4. Use AI to help you code, but make sure to break up the logic into small pieces. The AI will quickly turn your solution into a spaghetti mess if you don't break up the solution/code into smaller pieces and solve them one at a time.
11. How do you still improve after being in the field a little while?
    1. I use the unique skills that I have an innovative ways to solve problems rather than going with the status quo
    2. I'm always networking with people
12. Can you briefly explain some of the background knowledge that is needed before joining the field? 1.
13. What are some common misconceptions about the field that you have experienced for yourself?
    1. That it's all about defending against hackers
    2. That you need certs to show your value
    3. That cybersecurity is a cost center
14. How do you work every day to improve your skills as an analyst/coder?
    1. Listen to other programmers on what's going on in the industry
    2. Understand what problems have already been solved by other people
    3. Learn to speak the language
15. What are some beneficial factors to becoming an analyst/coder?
    1. You can integrate with things
    2. You can automate things
    3. You can answer questions with concrete data and examples that other people can't
    4. You can build your own tools to help other people do their job
16. Are there different levels of analysts or coders? Entry-level, Mid-level, Senior, etc?
    1. There are different levels. The mid-level and senior people usually define the architectures and large-scale processes. They also implement some of the core logic that's more advanced
    2. The senior people usually interact with other departments or upper level management to make sure that there's a buy-in and resources for people to do their job
17. Are there any new and innovative programs or technologies that is to be expected for this field either now or in the future? 1.
18. Is there anything that you would like to talk about specifically? 1.
