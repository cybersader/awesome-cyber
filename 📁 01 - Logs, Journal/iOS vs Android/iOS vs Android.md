> [!info] This is merely my opinion and experience with phones

# Why I don't like iPhones/iOS and Love Android
- Everything is proprietary and Apple seems to want royalties for all sorts of technology
- Some of their designs and UI are "aesthetic" but not really pragmatic
- Software landscape is limited
- Control over the phone/OS is more limited
- Messages system limited
- They load messages and images into their servers from other platforms in compressed/low quality even though other platforms don't always do that
- Charging ports finally using USB-C
- Always acting like their new stuff is revolutionary when it's really not
- UI interactions aren't efficient - no back button
- No simple universal back button like on Android. The X/back button changes depending on the application in many cases
- The swiping and changing screens feels slower and like it takes more steps to do anything
- (everything should be based around where your thumb is on the phone)
- No good autofill for password managers like Bitwarden
- No scheduled messages in default messaging app
- Stupid messages colors - distracting
- Highlighting text and moving cursor is annoying
- Moving photos off of phone annoying
- Less access to OS
- Lots of fluff with iOS

- Android has more fail safes
	- Setting alarms on Android tells you when the alarm will run and how many hours away that is
- With Android, you can reply and do actions from notifications
- Apple Maps is not as good as Google Maps
- Android has more customizability for aesthetic
- You can still have iPhone-like UI from Android settings
- Android has more app choices for things I like
