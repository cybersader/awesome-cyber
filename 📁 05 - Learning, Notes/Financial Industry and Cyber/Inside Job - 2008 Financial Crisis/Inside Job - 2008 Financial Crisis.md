# Iceland's Ponzi Banks
- Iceland
	- 13 billion GDP in 2008
	- Bank losses : $100 billion
	- Stable democracy
	- Low unemployment
- Had high quality of living
- In 2000, Iceland had deregulation policy for environment then the economy
- They allowed Aluminum smelting plants to ravage parts of the awesome landscape
- It's geothermal properties result in beautiful green landscapes?
- Government privatized Iceland's 3 largest banks - huge experiment in deregulation
- These 3 banks borrowed 120 billion from outside Iceland
- Stock prices went up and house prices doubled since banks had more to lend 
- Millionaires started taking out huge loans from Iceland banks
- It was essentially another Ponzi scheme
	- Banks set up money market funds
	- Banks advised deposit holders to put their money in money market funds
	- Their money would double and build in the bank (a lie)
	- New deposit holder money was used for loans to millionaires who saw they could buy stuff more easily with the new deregulation
- American accounting firms like KPMG audited and found nothing wrong
- American credit rating agencies also saw nothing wrong
- Iceland's banks collapsed in 2008
- Unemployment tripled in 6 months
- Money was essentially stolen and spent on stuff
- The only winners were the people that all that money went to
- If you went to banks, would find a bunch of lawyers/regulators who ironically went to work at banks?

- September 15 2008 - Lehman brothers declares bankruptcy
- World financial markets just started falling
- Largest insurance company AIG collapsed
- Caused global recession - 10s of trillions of dollars - 30 million unemployed - doubled national debt of US
- Destruction of equity and housing wealth
- This crisis was not an accident

- Since 1980s, the rise of US financial sector lead to damaging crises - yet..the industry makes more and more money from it
- After Great Depression, America had 40 years of growth without a financial crisis
- Finance was regulated tightly - banks were local businesses not allowed to speculate with depositors' savings
- Partners would put the money up traditionally

- In 1980s, investment banks went public with huge amounts of stockholder money - Wall Street investors were getting rich
- In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed CEO of the bank Merril Lynch as Secretary of Treasury
- They began a 30 year period of deregulation
- 1982 - deregulated savings and loan companies to make risky investments - 100s of these companies failed - costed taxpayers $124 billion
- Keating paid Alan Greenspan a lot of money - then Reagan appointed him chairman of Federal Reserve - he was reappointed Clinton and GW Bush
- All of the government figureheads had lobbied into Congress
- They captured the political system

- By late 1990s, financial sector consolidated into a few gigantic firms 
	- Clinton helped them grow
	- If any one of them failed, our economy would be hit hard
- Citicorp and Travelers merged to form largest financial company
	- Merger violated the Glass-Seagal Act - prevented consumer deposit banks from engaging in risky investment-banking activities
- Greenspan said nothing - Federal Reserve gave them an exemption for a year
- 1999 - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act - Citigroup relief act - overturned Glass-Seagal allowing future firms

- Late 90 crisis - investment banks fueled internet stock bubble - 5 trillion in investment losses
- SEC did nothing to regulate investment banking
- Scott Talbot chief lobbyist of Financial Services roundtable in Washington - strongest financial companies in the world

- Investigations started happening - defrauding, cooking books, conspiring with other countries, wall street drugs, criminal activity, lying to investors, fraud, etc.
- Derivatives allowed bankers to gamble on anything
	- bankruptcy of companies
	- weather
	- stock price falls
- Derivatives were unregulated
- CFTC tried to regulate derivatives
- Derivatives were a destabilizing market 
- They did not want to be regulated
- Brooksley Born, the spear of this regulation movement, was defeated by these banks

- Derivatives and financial innovations exploded after 2000 and 2001
- By the time GW Bush took office, derivatives and the financial sector were incredibly profitable
- The companies:
	- Investment banks - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merril Lynch, Bear Stearns
	- Financial conglomerates - Citigroup, JP Morgan
	- Securities and Insurance - AIG, MBIA, AMBAC  
	- Rating Agencies - Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch
- Securitization Food Chain
	- Home Buyers -> Lenders -> Investment Banks -> Investors
	- Connected trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans
	- Loan payments started at home buyers and went all the way up to investors
	- With each piece promising money back to the person below

- The risky system explained
	- [(35) CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation) that caused the global financial crisis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=uM19CBGhhas) 
	- Old system
		- mortgages take decades to pay so lenders were careful
	- New system
		- lenders sell mortgages to investment banks (they give investment banks money with interest?)
		- investment banks combine 1000s of mortgages and other loans to have  CDO (collateralized debt obligations) (complex derivatives)
		- Investment banks pay rating agencies to evaluate the CDOs
		- These had AAA ratings - popular for retirement funds (only highly rated securities)
	- The problem:
		- Lenders didn't care if borrowers could repay - made riskier loans
		- Investment banks wanted money - more CDOs is more money
		- Rating agencies had no liability if ratings were wrong - it could screw over tons of people though
- Number of mortgage loans quadrupled in 3 years (2000 - 2003)
- This is a fancy Ponzi scheme
- Subprime loans
	- These are the riskiest
	- Combining tons of risky loans into one makes them AAA on paper
	- Investment banks prefer these because they have higher interest rates
- Massive increase in predatory lending
# Part 2: The Bubble (2001 - 2007)
- 100s of billions of dollars were going through securitization chain
- Anyone could get a mortgage, so home purchases and housing prices went up
- Subprime lending increase from 30 to 600 billion in 10 years
- Cash bonuses spiked during bubbles
- This was essentially stealing money though
- A global Ponzi scheme
- SEC had no one working

- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240424104600.png)

- Investment banks borrowed to buy more loans and create CDOs
- Ratio between bank's money and borrowed money ("leverage") meant more borrowed money - more leverage
- 2004 - Goldman Sachs got SEC to relax limits on leverage - allowed banks to get more leverage and gamble more
- The amount of leverage went from 3:1 to like 33:1
- You can do the math on this to see when they fail
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240424104613.png)
- Leverage and failure threshold:
	- 33:1 means 100/33 = ~%3 decrease in value of asset till they lose everything
	- If they had a slight decrease and took too much risk, then they can't pay anyone back

- Credit default swaps - the other ticking time bomb
	- These were derivatives
	- For investors who owned CDOs, credit default swaps worked like insurance
	- This countered the leverage problem
	- Insurance companies like AIG could pay investors for CDO losses
	- Speculators could also buy these to bet against CDOs that they didn't own
	- These were unregulated
	- AIG didn't have to put money aside for losses - they would pay employees cash bonuses when contracts were signed - this left AIG on the hook
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240424104402.png)
	- 
- This was a distorted system of compensation

- One guy, Rajan, at the biggest banking conference in the world presented a paper showing how the financial industry was riskier
- Incentives based on short-term profits were incentives to take bigger risks without accounting for the potential losses
	- He showed how it could cause meltdown
	- They have to compensate for risk adjustment performance
	- "More profits with more risk"

- Financial executives borrowed this money from the bottom of the food chain (people paying their loans) and they used it for their extravagant lifestyles
	- Once the money was used, it was dissipated into the economy and irretrievable
	- The money is essentially stolen at this point

- Wall Street had tons of drugs, prostitution, and debauchery
- They were spending corporate money
- "Make your own invoice"
- This extended to the top of these companies

- Godman Sachs would buy credit default swaps and bet against others based on stats
- Gaoldman Sachs knew AIG would fail so they spent 150 million insuring against the collapse of AIG
- In 2007, they sold CDOs designed to make money when their customers lost
- In 2010, they had to testify against Congress
	- They would convince clients to buy terrible loans so they could make money
	- They declined telling clients of their adverse interest
	- "Do you a duty to act in best interest of clients" -- reply: "Show them prices on transactions that they ask for" (so no)
	- What do you think about selling securities that your company knows is crap?  
	- "It's unfortunate someone said that in email" -- ...WOW
