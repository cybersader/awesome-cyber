# Iceland's Ponzi Banks
- Iceland
	- 13 billion GDP in 2008
	- Bank losses : $100 billion
	- Stable democracy
	- Low unemployment
- Had high quality of living
- In 2000, Iceland had deregulation policy for environment then the economy
- They allowed Aluminum smelting plants to ravage parts of the awesome landscape
- It's geothermal properties result in beautiful green landscapes?
- Government privatized Iceland's 3 largest banks - huge experiment in deregulation
- These 3 banks borrowed 120 billion from outside Iceland
- Stock prices went up and house prices doubled since banks had more to lend 
- Millionaires started taking out huge loans from Iceland banks
- It was essentially another Ponzi scheme
	- Banks set up money market funds
	- Banks advised deposit holders to put their money in money market funds
	- Their money would double and build in the bank (a lie)
	- New deposit holder money was used for loans to millionaires who saw they could buy stuff more easily with the new deregulation
- American accounting firms like KPMG audited and found nothing wrong
- American credit rating agencies also saw nothing wrong
- Iceland's banks collapsed in 2008
- Unemployment tripled in 6 months
- Money was essentially stolen and spent on stuff
- The only winners were the people that all that money went to
- If you went to banks, would find a bunch of lawyers/regulators who ironically went to work at banks?
